<p>I am accepting graduate students and undergraduates interested in sociological, anthropological, and historical approaches to understanding computer science as a social activity. </p>
<h3 id="Areas-I’m-looking-for-students-interested-in"><a href="#Areas-I’m-looking-for-students-interested-in" class="headerlink" title="Areas I’m looking for students interested in"></a>Areas I’m looking for students interested in</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Computer Science Education</strong>, particularly: ethics education for CS, policy and CS education, gatekeeping in CS education, educator development, critical pedagogy, sustainability education for CS, and the history of CS education</li>
<li><strong>Sociology of Computer Science</strong>, particularly: boundary work surrounding CS as an academic discipline, <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~patitsas/publications/icse_2019_gender.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occupational closure</a>, <a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/josi.12289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">masculinity contest cultures</a>, and the relationships between CS education and the tech industry</li>
<li><strong>Science and Technology Studies</strong> (STS), particularly: <a href="https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29607" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crip technoscience</a>, <a href="https://queersts.com/work-group/manifest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">queer technoscience</a>, and  postcolonial STS</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal candidates bring multiple areas listed above together.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with STS and trying to get a sense of what asking STS-style questions about CS education looks like, I recommend reading my student Horatiu Halmaghi’s Master’s thesis! (Scroll up to supervised theses.)</p>
<h3 id="Areas-I-don’t-advise"><a href="#Areas-I-don’t-advise" class="headerlink" title="Areas I don’t advise"></a>Areas I don’t advise</h3><!--- *For students interested in CS education*: if you do not already have a background in education or sociology, please read this paper by Kafai et al before emailing me: [an introduciton to cognitive, situated and critical framings of CS education](https://chrisproctor.net/media/publications/kafai_2019_theory_dialogue.pdf). Why read this paper? I advise students who use critical approaches to CS education. I am not looking for students who are seeking to take a cognitivist approach.  -->
<p>Please note that <strong>I do not advise projects which involve creating/developing computational tools.</strong> If you’re looking for somebody to advise educational technology research you are looking at the wrong professor! Here are some McGill profs whose research is actually on ed tech: <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/edu-ecp/adam-dube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Dubé</a> and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/experimentalsurgery/faculty/jason-matthew-harley-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Harley</a>. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for somebody who takes a critical approach for making computational things, you’re in warmer territory. (I do like critical approaches!) But again, I don’t advise projects about making things. Here are some cool HCI people who do: <a href="https://www.ishtiaque.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ishtiaque Ahmed (Toronto)</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~mcosmin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cosmin Munteanu (Toronto)</a>, <a href="https://ischool.ubc.ca/profile/lisa-nathan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Nathan (UBC)</a>, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science/ben-shapiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Shapiro (CU Boulder)</a>, and <a href="https://aimihamraie.wordpress.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimi Hamraie (Vanderbilt)</a>. (Also have a look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/fundedphdinhci?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funded PhD in HCI page</a>!) <!--(Also have a look at who is publishing at [CSCW](https://dl.acm.org/conference/cscw) these days.)--></p>
<p>If your proposed project involves language along the lines of “I want to use machine learning to…” you’re very much in the wrong place. I do not advise projects that apply machine learning. (Note: I do advise projects about how we should <em>teach</em> machine learning!) Here are some McGill profs who actually do computational social science: <a href="https://petermcmahan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter McMahan</a>, <a href="http://www.reirab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reihaneh Rabbany</a> and <a href="http://sivareddy.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siva Reddy</a>.</p>
<!--- Similary, I do not advise projects on educational technology research. My research focuses on the social forces which shape computer science as a social institution.--->
<h3 id="Interested-Students-Already-at-McGill"><a href="#Interested-Students-Already-at-McGill" class="headerlink" title="Interested Students Already at McGill"></a>Interested Students Already at McGill</h3><p>I have a general policy of only accepting students who regularly attend one or both of the <a href="http://socialstudies.cs.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two reading groups</a> associated with the research group. This is the best way to get involved in my reserach group and acquainted with the team.</p>
<p>If you find it a valuable experience after attending more than once, let me know and we’ll find time to talk!</p>
<p>If you cannot attend one of the reading groups, see below. In your email, you must explain why you can’t attend reading group.</p>
<h3 id="Interested-Students-Not-Already-at-McGill"><a href="#Interested-Students-Not-Already-at-McGill" class="headerlink" title="Interested Students Not Already at McGill"></a>Interested Students Not Already at McGill</h3><p>Before contacting me, take some time to consider what it is you want to study in graduate school, and whether that falls under the areas I do advise vs the areas I don’t advise. If your interests do seem aligned, send me an email telling me what topic(s) you are interested in studying. </p>
<p>I am looking for something much more specific than “computer science education” or “science and technology studies” — what questions/issues are you personally interested in tackling?</p>
<p>Useful information for you to tell me in your email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which programme do you want to apply to? <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/graduate/admission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compsci</a> or <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/dise/grad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education</a>? Master’s or PhD?<br><strong>Note:</strong> in Canada, a Master’s is generally expected before starting a PhD, and is considered a transitionary degree toward a PhD</li>
<li>Which term you would want to start your graduate studies</li>
<li>Why are you interested in grad school? What are your career goals?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in doing research with me?</li>
<li>What research experience you have (if any)</li>
<li>What teaching experience you have (if any)</li>
<li>What writing experience you have — if you can share a piece or two of your writing that you’re proud of, this is useful for me. Research involves a lot of reading and writing, so I am looking for students with strong communication skills in English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your email should contain the word “narwhal” in the subject header, so I can tell you took the time to do your research and read this page.</p>
<p>Useful resources for potential students — worth reading before emailing!</p>
