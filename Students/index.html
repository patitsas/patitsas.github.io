<p>I am accepting graduate students and undergraduates interested in sociological, anthropological, historical and psychological approaches to understanding computer science as a social/human activity. </p>
<p><strong>Areas I’m particularly interested in:</strong> computer science education, sociology of computer science, science and technology studies, and gender/disability/queer/post-colonial studies.</p>
<p>Please note that while I am interested in software engineering and human-computer interaction, <strong>I do not advise projects which involve creating/developing computational tools.</strong> My research focuses on social factors in education &amp; science &amp; technology, not creating technology.</p>
<!---
*For students interested in CS education*: if you do not already have a background in education or sociology, please read this paper by Kafai et al before emailing me: [an introduciton to cognitive, situated and critical framings of CS education](https://chrisproctor.net/media/publications/kafai_2019_theory_dialogue.pdf). Why read this paper? I advise students who use situated and/or critical approaches to CS education; I am not looking for students who are seeking to take a cognitivist approach.

<h3 id="Interested-Students-Already-at-McGill"><a href="#Interested-Students-Already-at-McGill" class="headerlink" title="Interested Students Already at McGill"></a>Interested Students Already at McGill</h3><p>I have a general policy of only accepting students who regularly attend one or both of the <a href="http://socialstudies.cs.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two reading groups</a> associated with the research group. This is the best way to get involved in my reserach group and acquainted with the team.</p>
<p>If you find it a valuable experience after attending more than once, let me know and we’ll find time to talk!</p>
<p>If you cannot attend one of the reading groups, see below. In your email, you must explain why you can’t attend reading group.</p>
<h3 id="Interested-Students-Not-Already-at-McGill"><a href="#Interested-Students-Not-Already-at-McGill" class="headerlink" title="Interested Students Not Already at McGill"></a>Interested Students Not Already at McGill</h3><p>Send me an email telling me what topic(s) you are interested in studying. </p>
<p>I am looking for something much more specific than “computer science education” or “human-computer education” — what questions/issues are you personally interested in tackling?</p>
<p>Useful information for you to tell me in your email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which programme do you want to apply to? <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/graduate/admission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compsci</a> or <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/dise/grad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education</a>? Master’s or PhD?<br><strong>Note:</strong> in Canada, a Master’s is generally expected before starting a PhD, and is considered a transitionary degree toward a PhD</li>
<li>Which term you would want to start your graduate studies</li>
<li>Why are you interested in grad school? What are your career goals?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in doing research with me?</li>
<li>What research experience you have (if any)</li>
<li>What teaching experience you have (if any)</li>
<li>What writing experience you have — if you can share a piece or two of your writing that you’re proud of, this is useful for me. Research involves a lot of reading and writing, so I am looking for students with strong communication skills in English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your email should contain the word “penguin” in the subject header, so I can tell you took the time to do your research and read this page.</p>
<p>Useful resources for potential students — worth reading before emailing!</p>
