        <p>Sociologists like to use performance as a metaphor for everyday life. Erving Goffman in particular championed the metaphor, bringing to light how our social interactions take place on various stages according to various scripts. And when people don’t follow the right script on the right stage, social punishment ensues (e.g. <em>stigma</em>). </p>
<p>Pierre Bourdieu rather similarly described social interactions as taking place in arenas, seeing them more like games than plays. (Sometimes <em>champs</em> is translated as ‘field’ rather than arena; it’s worth noting Bourdieu intended for it to have a connation of sport/war.) Rather than a script, people get a sense for the rules of the game. And when people don’t follow the rules of the game, social punishment ensues.</p>
<p>Whether one is failing at a social game or performance, social punishment can take many forms. For example, sexual harassment is most reported by those who go against gender roles. Powerful women are more likely to be harassed than less powerful women. Women in male-dominated fields are more likely to be harassed. Men who are effeminate, gay, or champions of feminism, are more likely to be harassed. Harassers act to keep people “in their place”.</p>
<p>Since not following the script/game is costly for individuals, we’re trained from a young age to be on the lookout for cues about what stage/arena we’re on and what role we should be playing. Looking for and responding to cues is something we do automatically most of the time. Kahneman would see it as an example of System 1 thinking.</p>
<p>Impostor syndrome is the sense that you’re the wrong person to be playing the role you’re in. You’re acting a role that you’ve been trained in and hired for – but your brain is picking up on cues that signal that you’re not right for the role.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The Caltech Counselling Centre has this to say on “<a href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is likely to have the impostor syndrome?</a>“:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attitudes, beliefs, direct or indirect messages that we received from our parents or from other significant people in our lives early on may have contributed to the development of impostor feelings. Certain family situations and dynamics tend to contribute to impostor feelings: when the success and career aspirations conflicts with the family expectations of the gender, race, religion, or age of the person, families who impose unrealistic standards, families who are very critical, and families who are ridden with conflict and anger. </p>
<p>Some researchers identify two main types of family dynamics that can contribute to impostor feelings, although there may be others. </p>
<p>Family Labels:&nbsp; Different children in a family may be identified or labeled differently.&nbsp; For example, some families have one “intelligent” child and one “sensitive” child.&nbsp; While growing up, many times families will not change their perception of each child, no matter what that child does.&nbsp; Therefore, the sensitive child, even if she gets better grades or more awards may not be recognized for her intelligence.&nbsp; This can lead to doubting her intelligence and believing the family is correct even with evidence, which contradicts these labels.&nbsp;<br>The sensitive child in this example has been raised to play the script of the sensitive child. When they go on to play other roles, they still sometimes encounter social cues indicating they’re in the wrong role. Impostor syndrome results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impostor syndrome is thought to be quite common amongst women in science. In this light I don’t think it’s surprising: there are so many cues in society that we are not what a ‘scientist’ is supposed to look or act like. We don’t fit the stereotypes. Many female scientists were raised to be that sensitive child.</p>
<p>I started reading about impostor syndrome when I was asked if I had any ideas on whether Impostor Syndrome is a recent phenomenon in society. The syndrome was first termed in the 70s, but sociologists and psychologists had described similar things well before then.</p>
<p>I would expect its prevalence is a relatively recent phenomenon. In “the good old days” people had extremely rigid options for what roles they could have in society. Women had few if any career options. There was little social mobility. Non-white people had even less social mobility. Most people followed a career trajectory sculpted by their parents – not by themselves. And so, people had a script determined for them. Relatively few people had the ability to deviate from it successfully. They could only play roles that had been assigned to them.</p>
<p>In modern society, most of us have the privilege of picking the roles we want to play. Regardless of whether we were raised to fit the role, or look like the stereotype. I don’t think people with impostor syndrome are crazy:_ I think they’re picking up on cues that they’re not in a role they were created to be in_.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the times I’ve experienced impostor syndrome, they were situations where I didn’t look the part (too young, too female). Or they were situations that I hadn’t been raised to fit into – I was raised to be nerdy/geeky. I feel like an impostor at the gym, and I definitely felt like an impostor when I taught a fencing class many years ago.</p>
<p>I don’t have a magic answer for getting over impostor syndrome, and the link between social cues and impostor syndrome stands only as a hypothesis at this point. But I do think we impostors are necessary to subvert social scripts. Just because you don’t look the stereotype or were raised to do doesn’t mean you can’t, and hopefully that won’t stop you.</p>

        <p>Theories from psychology enjoy a fair bit of use in computer science education, but education is not merely a cognitive process: it’s also a social one.</p>
<p>I’ve found it useful to learn about social theory as a CS education graduate student, and I thought I’d share a quick introduction to social theory that I initially wrote for my research proposal to my thesis committee this fall.</p>
<h3 id="Classical-Social-Theory"><a href="#Classical-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Classical Social Theory"></a>Classical Social Theory</h3><p>Classically, sociology has had four major schools of thought, each of which goes by various names and is associated with one of the four “founders” of sociology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Auguste Comte</strong> (1798-1857) coined the term “positive philosophy”, now better known as positivism. Comte’s sociology was inspired by the French Revolution: sociology was envisioned as a means to produce the perfect society. (Indeed, Comte was incensed that the lower classes wouldn’t simply accept their “place” in society.)<br>In Comte’s world, one would test out different ideas for how to run a society, and find the optimal approach. While Comte himself argued for holism, (post)positivism has since come to be associated with reductionism.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sociology of <strong>Max Weber </strong>(1864-1920) contrasts with Comte’s: Weber was a proponent of anti-positivism  (also known as constructivism or interpretivism). Weber saw <em>verstehen</em> (understanding) as the goal of research, rather than hypothesis verification. Weber theorized upon social stratification; he also wrote about closure (how groups draw the boundaries and construct identities, and compete with out-group members for scarce resources.)</p>
<p>Weber’s sociology put an emphasis on ideology. Capitalism, for example, was the result of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICppFQ6Tabw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideological conditions unique to Northern Europe</a>; capitalism has only succeeded where these ideological conditions hold.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emile Durkheim</strong> (1858-1917) built on Comte’s positivism, setting forth <em>structural functionalism</em>. In structural functionalism, a society is viewed like a biological cell: different parts of a society are likened organelles. Durkheim’s sociology looks at how the parts work together to comprise the whole. It is also holistic – much of how systems thinking was used in the social sciences built on Durkheimian notions of society.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>Karl Marx </strong>(1818-1883) provided an approach which contrasts with Durkheim’s: instead of seeing harmony, it emphasizes the role of class conflict in society and the historical-economic basis thereof. Marxist sociology has also been known as <em>conflict theory</em>, though the historical-economic basis is not the only way one could study conflict. For example, Weberians see conflict rooted in ideology, rather than in a clash over resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="20th-Century-Social-Theory"><a href="#20th-Century-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="20th Century Social Theory"></a>20th Century Social Theory</h3><p>While classical theory is often referred to in terms of thinkers (Marx, Weber, etc), the more modern movements tend to be known more by schools of thought. Some of the major ones would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Neo-Marxism</strong> refers to the 20th century updates of Marxist theory, which  has pulled in Weberian and poststructuralist work on status and power.  Antonio Gramsci is a well-known neo-Marxist, who was curious about the  question of why the revolution Marx had predicted never seemed to come about. Gramsci is most famous for his theory of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cHThwyA8RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural hegemony</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical theory</strong> is also based on Marxist thought, and is often conflated with it. Critical theory emphasizes <em>praxis</em>, the combination of theory and practice. Critical theory is most associated with the Frankfurt School, including names such as Theodor Adorno and Jurgen Habermas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interactionism</strong> assumes that all social processes are the result of human interaction. It emerged in the early 20th century. Interactionaists focus their studies on the interactions between individuals. As a result, interactionists do not `see’ the effects of physical environment – or even solitary thought/work. They also reject quantitative data in favour of qualitative approaches: grounded theory and ethnomethodology were both developed by interactionists. The notion of social interaction as a performance was first developed in interactionist thought; poststructuralists have since refined it. While there’s no single name associated with this perspective, some associated names include George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, and Dorothy Smith.<br>Sociologists also look at social systems at different levels: the <em>macro</em> level looks at entire societies, nations, etc; the <em>meso</em> level looks at organizations, institutions, etc; the <em>micro</em> level looks at individuals. While classical sociology was generally macro, interactionism focuses on the micro level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Structuralism</strong> might be seen as a macro-focused backlash against interactionism’s focus on the micro. Structuralism sees social processes as stemming from larger, overarching structures, and also emerged in the early 20th century. Structuralists see society as being governed by these structures in a somewhat analogous fashion to how physicists may see the universe as being governed by laws of nature. A criticism of structuralism is that it sees these structures as fixed; in contrast a Marxist would focus on historical change. Some structuralists include Claude Levi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, and Jean Piaget.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Poststructuralism</strong> (more or less interchangeable with “postmodernism”) is not a particularly coherent school of thought. This is not altogether surprising as the key poststructuralists both reject the label and the very notion that there is such a real thing as poststructuralism. Poststructuralists reject the idea of “objective” knowledge: since the study of sociology is done by humans who are biased by history and culture, they argue that any study of a social phenomenon must be combined with how the study of that social phenomenon was produced. For example, a poststructuralist would not take a concept like `gender’ as a given, but problematize the concept. Poststructuralism evolved out of structuralism in the mid 20th century. Some major poststructuralists include Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler.</li>

        <p>I thought I’d have a look at the status of high school CS across Canada. (I’m keeping this to provinces/territories that have a population greater than 500,000.)</p>
<p>Overall, it’s generally categorized as an elective, often lumped in with fine arts and second languages. BC, Alberta and Manitoba are the only provinces where it is categorized as a teachable subject at the BEd level; in Ontario it is available as a minor. (Quebec, as usual, is a beast of its own not easily comparable to the other provinces.)</p>
<p>Western Canada seems to be leading the pack for standards and teacher support – the only CSTA chapters in Canada are in BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.</p>
<p>Atlantic Canada is furthest behind: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador do not appear to have computer science curricula, let alone CS teacher training/support.</p>
<p>Nowhere easily available on the internet could I find stats on how many schools teach CS or how many students take it – this information is FOIable if anybody really wants to see the numbers. (If you do have the numbers, I’d love to see them!)</p>
<p><strong>British Columbia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>British Columbia does have a CS curriculum. It’s lumped in with “computer studies” that is mostly IT. It is categorized as “<a href="http://www.aved.gov.bc.ca/abe/docs/handbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applied Skills</a>“ rather than a Science or Math.</li>
<li>CS is <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=86CA1D62603948EBBDC4410399842DED&amp;title=Certificate%20of%20Graduation" title="Certificate%20of%20Graduation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not categorized as required course for a high school diploma</a>, but can be counted as an elective topic. BC students need to take 28 credits of elective topics.</li>
<li>The University of British Columbia offers a <a href="http://teach.educ.ubc.ca/bachelor-of-education-program/secondary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEd in computer science</a>, as does the University of Victoria and the University of Northern BC. I can’t find any BSc/BEd combined programmes for CS.</li>
<li>There is a CSTA chapter for BC.</li>
<li><p>I can’t find any stats on how many BC schools teach CS. My impression is that it’s not uncommon in Vancouver but rare elsewhere.<br><a name="more"></a><strong>Alberta:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>The Albertan universities (University of Alberta, U of Calgary, U of Lethbridge) accept <a href="http://cacsaic.org/HowAlbertaGotCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high school computer science as science credit</a> for entry to their science programmes</p>
</li>
<li>High school CS counts for graduation requirements <a href="http://www.education.alberta.ca/media/8765464/guide_to_education_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a elective, not as science or math.</a> This said, students need to take 10 credits from the elective list (CS, fine arts, apprenticeships, PE, and second languages.) There are multiple CS courses on the books in Alberta’s education system.</li>
<li>The University of Alberta offers a BEd in computer science as well as a <a href="http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Science/Programs/193.4.html#193.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combined BSc/BEd programme in CS</a>. The Universities of Calgary and Lethbridge do not offer BEd programmes in CS.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="http://cstaab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSTA chapter for Alberta</a>.</li>
<li><p>I can’t find any stats on how many schools offer CS. The high school I attended in Lethbridge did not offer CS when I was a student (I was class of 2007) and I don’t know anybody from Alberta who took high school CS.<strong><br>**</strong>Saskatchewan:**</p>
</li>
<li><p>Saskatchewan does have a <a href="https://www.edonline.sk.ca/bbcswebdav/library/curricula/English/Science/Computer_Science_20_30_1999.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high school CS curriculum</a> (CS 20/30). It is not required for a high school diploma. It appears that <a href="http://www.education.gov.sk.ca/core-principles-time-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS 20 can count as a science elective</a>, but not CS 30?</p>
</li>
<li>Computer Science 20 is mentioned in some Saskatchewan Education documents but not CS 30 – I’m guessing CS 30 is not widely taught?*   Computer Science 30 <a href="http://www.uregina.ca/futurestudents/admissions/hs-students/saskatchewan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counts for science credit</a> when applying to the University of Regina but <em>not</em> at the University of Saskatchewan.</li>
<li>Neither U of Saskatchewan nor Regina offer BEd programmes in CS.*   There is a CSTA chapter for Saskatchewan.</li>
<li><p>I can’t find any stats on how many schools offer CS.<br><strong>Manitoba:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>CS is <a href="http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/docs/parents/grad/grad_require.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not required</a> for high school graduation – or even listed in the electives section. There is a <a href="http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/cs/framework.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high school CS curriculum</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>The University of Manitoba has a BEd in CS, but not the University of Winnipeg.*   There is a CSTA chapter for Manitoba.&nbsp;</li>
<li><p>I can’t find any stats on how many schools offer CS.<br><strong>Ontario:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>CS is not required for high school graduation. Students do need to take <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/graduate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one credit from</a> science, computer studies, IT, and French. There is <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/computer10to12_2008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a high school CS curriculum</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>Computer science is not available to as a major in BEd programmes, but only as a minor.</li>
<li><p>There is no CSTA chapter for Ontario. And as usual, I can’t find any stats on how many schools offer CS.<strong><br>Quebec:</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Quebec has a very different education system from the rest of Canada: students complete a secondary diploma in grade 11 then go to CEGEP for a couple years before going to university. CEGEP covers the equivalent of first year university. I’m hesitant to compare Quebec’s education system to the other provinces as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>Computer and technology studies count as a science for secondary diploma purposes. I can’t find a CS curriculum for the secondary level, however.</li>
<li>Computer science (<em>informatique</em>) appears available at all the CEGEPs in Quebec in some form or another.</li>
<li><p>There is no CSTA chapter, nor clearly available stats.<br><strong>New Brunswick:</strong></p>
</li>

I had fun putting together drinks:</p>
<p><em>Positivist koolaid:</em> your standard red koolaid. People will disagree what the red is supposed to be – cherry? strawberry? “red”? You grew up with it and remember it nostalgically but don’t really want to have some now that you’ve had more grown up drinks. </p>
<p><em>Postpositivist koolaid</em>: it’s the same red koolaid as the positivist koolaid, but your drink comes garnished with a lemon slice.</p>
<p><em>Critical theory koolaid</em>: the praxis of the sweet-yet-sour lemonade of theory with the harsh reality of ginger ale. While some would point out this is not actually “koolaid”, they’re missing the point. Drinking it makes you feel a little better about yourself.</p>
<p>_Postmodernist “koolaid”: _there is no such thing as “koolaid”, nor the little umbrella that your drink is garnished with. After all, “koolaid” exists only through discourse and is socially constructed. A Foucaultian archaeological analysis indicates that the discourse originates through a combination of cranberry juice and tonic water, its bitterness a nod to Nietzsche – and the fact that the drink is an acquired taste that is generally seen as unpalatable without gin.</p>

        <p>I’ve been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bourdieu</a> kick for the course I’m currently taking on social theory (LHA 1803Y: Theory in Higher Education), and since <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Easterbrook</a> mentioned he wasn’t familiar with Bourdieu, I figured I’d write a quick and dirty introduction to Bourdieu’s social theories. Steve’s a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416545842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+in+systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems thinker</a> so this is written for such an audience.</p>
<p>In systems thinking we like to think of people as existing in many (overlapping) social <em>systems</em> (because, after all, pretty much everything to a systems thinker is a system.) These social systems can be things like school, work, a professional community, or even your favourite internet community.</p>
<p>Bourdieu would call those systems <em>fields</em>. (Specifically, a field is a system of social positions, with internal structure.) In his terminology, the rules determining the system/fields are known as <em>nomos</em>. (Fields are not the same as class, which I’ll get to later.) When people in fields ‘play by the rules’ of the system, and invest in it, he calls this <em>illusio.</em></p>
<p>If you’re wondering if he also has paradigms in his systems, the answer is yes! He calls them <em>doxa</em>, the concepts and ideas which go without saying as it comes without saying – “the universe of possible discourse”.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="Individuals"><a href="#Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Individuals"></a>Individuals</h2><p>As an individual, I interact with numerous fields. There are two things that matter about me in how I interact with these fields: my capital, and my <em>habitus.</em></p>
<p>Bourdieu distinguishes numerous forms of capital:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>economic capital</em>, how many financial assets I have</li>
<li><em>social capital</em>, who I know, my social networks, what I can get out them, etc.</li>
<li><em>cultural capital</em>, the knowledge, skills, advantages and education that I have – along with the cultural ‘know-how’ of how to navigate particular social situations</li>
<li><em>symbolic capital</em>, the resources available to me on the basis of honour, prestige, recognition, or my other forms of capitalA thing worth noting about capital is that its value is context-dependent. For example, my knowledge of Star Trek trivia (which is cultural capital), has use in nerdy fields like computer science, but less so at gatherings of my extended family. Similarly, my Canadian money is of lesser value outside of Canada, and even less value were I to visit a society with a bartering or gift-giving economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for <em>habitus</em>, the description on Wikipedia wraps it up nicely: “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_%28sociology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the habitus </a>could be understood as a structure of the mind characterized by a set of acquired schemata, sensibilities, dispositions and taste”. Your habitus is developed in part through socialization. Bourdieu conceived of habitus as a way to study the interaction area between individual and society – in software engineering terms you might think of your habitus as being the coupler between an individual and society.</p>
<p>Every individual has a habitus – but likeminded individuals together can have group habitus. For example, a <em>class habitus</em> would refer to sensibilities, dispositions, tastes and ways of thinking about the world that are common to a social class. </p>
<h2 id="Class"><a href="#Class" class="headerlink" title="Class"></a>Class</h2><p>Unlike previous social theorists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weber</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marx</a>, Bourdieu’s view of class is not based on just economic capital, but instead on all capital (social, cultural, economic, symbolic). For me this is an appeal of Bourdieu: it explains why a ‘blue collar’ tradesman making the same amount of money as a ‘white collar’ adjunct are not really the same class.</p>
<p>Much of Bourdieu’s work looks at the reproduction of social inequality. He identifies feedback loops (though not by name) of what keeps the classes separate – and cultural capital plays a major role. How much cultural capital a person has, and to what social standing they are born, are determine their social mobility.</p>
<p>Those with a large amount of cultural capital in society are able to determine <em>taste</em> in society – such as what is low-brow vs. high brow (and everything in between). And people judge other people based on taste – does somebody ‘fit’ into a particular field? When people don’t fit in to a particular field, <em>symbolic violence</em> is used to keep them out or make them feel uncomfortable. Symbolic violence (also known as symbolic power) comprises things like implicit biases, microaggressions, de facto discrimination, and all that other lovely stuff that’s used to “keep them in their place”.</p>
<p>Symbolic violence allows for the reproduction of social divisions. A kid growing up in a working class family is going to have less access to means of accumulating cultural capital, is more likely to be affected by class dispositions to not value education as highly, and is more likely to say and do things when interacting with intellectuals that make them stick out like a sore thumb. Indeed, Bourdieu focuses extensively on the little things that stop people (or allow people) to accumulate capital – what they wear, the things they say, the hobbies they have – for him it’s all about the gain on the feedback loops here. The word ‘accumulation’ tends to come up a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><p>The stories women have of not feeling like they belong in tech/CS are the type of thing very amenable to a Bourdieusian analysis. Indeed, his early work focused on how the French university system amplified social inequalities (both in terms of gender and of class – and the intersection of the two, well before the term _intersectionality _took off).</p>
<p>His work has been used quite a bit by sociologists to look at the reproduction of social inequalities – for example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21133/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> used Bourdieu to examine how low-income minority ethnic groups feel alienated when they go to science museums – and why they don’t really go to them in the first place (hint: <em>habitus</em> plays a role – they have not been socially conditioned to see museums as a thing worth going to).</p>
<p>In many ways Bourdieu was a systems thinker – he thought of feedback loops, systems-within-systems, and systems-level behaviours, structures, rules and paradigms – but did not have the systems thinking vocabulary available to him. While he was active at the same time as the Systems Thinkers in the English-speaking world, few Systems Thinking based books have been translated into French – and most of the translations happened after Bourdieu died in 2002 (for example, Limits to Growth <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Limites-croissance-dans-monde-fini/dp/291777035X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416549088&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=donella+meadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t translated into French until 2012</a>!)</p>

        <p>I’m interested in studying diversity initiatives in CS education – and in doing so I consider it helpful to have a model of the different types of diversity initiatives that are used to recruit/retain women and other underrepresented groups in CS. But how can we come up with a useful model? This blog post is what I’ve come up with so far – where I started (explicit and implicit interventions) and where I recently arrived to (adapting the USI model of public health interventions to this context). It’s a work in progress and I’d love feedback.</p>
<h2 id="Explicit-and-Implicit-Interventions"><a href="#Explicit-and-Implicit-Interventions" class="headerlink" title="Explicit and Implicit Interventions"></a>Explicit and Implicit Interventions</h2><p>First, I want to walk you through how I have mostly been thinking about diversity initiatives. I currently categorize them like so:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit interventions</strong>: these target women (or other groups) and are explicit in their purpose. For example:<pre><code>*   Departmental women-in-CS clubs at many universities
</code></pre><ul>
<li>The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and similar conferences</li>
<li>Mentorship programmes for women in CS, like <a href="http://www.cra-w.org/dmp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRA-W’s</a></li>
<li>Outreach initiatives like <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/Gr8_Designs_for_Gr8_Girls_Changes_Young_Girls__Perceptions_of_Computer_Science.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gr8Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girlsmarts</a></li>
<li>Grassroots bootcamps/workshops like <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Girls Code</a> and <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladies Learning Code</a></li>
<li>Awards/scholarships/grants for women, like the <a href="http://www.google.ca/anitaborg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Borg Scholarship</a>All of these both are intended for women/girls, and in the process, the women/girls participating <em>know</em> the intervention is for women/girls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implicit interventions</strong>: these are <em>stealthy</em> – they are open to <em>everybody</em> and do not advertise the goal of supporting women in CS. Instead these are approaches which are known to benefit women disproportionately (and may also benefit dominant groups). For example:<pre><code>*   A CS professor uses [pair-programming](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1060075) and [peer instruction](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/74/2/10.1119/1.2162549) in their class, and [randomly calls on students in a structured fashion](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1060071.1060073) -- all are known to disproportionately benefit female students -- but the professor does not tell her students she is doing this for the female students&apos; sake.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>A CS professor has their students <a href="http://rer.sagepub.com/content/81/2/267.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write a value-affirming essay</a> as an assignment at the beginning of term – this is known to help women overcome stereotype treat in male-dominated disciplines.</li>
<li>A CS department provides a mentorship programme to all students.<em>   A university mandates that all students need to take CS, and its CS department provides multiple, engaging, versions of CS1 that are tailored to different students’ interests, <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2381100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">à la Harvey Mudd</a>.</em>   A conference switches to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534707002704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using blind review of its submissions</a>, which is known to disproportionately benefit women.<br>The implicit interventions have a fairly different feel to them. For one thing, they tend not to just help women – these can also disproportionately help students of colour, students of low SES backgrounds, LGBTQ+ students, etc. These interventions change the system, rather than give underrepresented groups like women a buffer in an unwelcoming system.<br><a name="more"></a><br>The implicit interventions also move away <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tea.20241/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from singling out minority groups as though it is us women who have the problem</a>, to instead working from an assumption that it is the CS classroom/department/workplace/etc that has the problem. (And btw, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/79/5/736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicit interventions can cause stereotype threat</a>: “we’re gonna help you because you’re a woman” is still reducing somebody to their gender.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there’s some limitations to this model of explicit vs. implicit interventions. What if a professor did pair-programming in class but said it was to benefit the women? I’m not sure what I’d do with that. My categories were also clearly thought up about group-level interventions. In one of my committee meetings, Mark Guzdial asked me how one would categorize a CS professor spending extra time with a female student, encouraging her one-on-one. This also doesn’t really nicely fit into the current model.</p>
<h2 id="The-Universal-Selected-Indicated-USI-Model-of-Suicide-Prevention"><a href="#The-Universal-Selected-Indicated-USI-Model-of-Suicide-Prevention" class="headerlink" title="The Universal-Selected-Indicated (USI) Model of Suicide Prevention"></a>The Universal-Selected-Indicated (USI) Model of Suicide Prevention</h2><p>Greg Wilson recently retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/liamdevlincasey/status/532311970767454208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fascinating report on suicide in Toronto</a>, which I was looking through earlier today out of curiosity. This particular section caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_<strong>4.2 Preventive interventions </strong></p>
<p>A public health approach to suicide prevention includes both universal interventions in the whole population and interventions targeted to key risk groups. Rose’s Theorem makes the case for prioritizing universal interventions because a large number of people at small risk may give rise to more cases of disease than a small number who are at high risk.[106,107] </p>
<p>A model for understanding prevention interventions is the Universal, Selective and Indicated (USI) model, which breaks the targeted interventions down into selective and indicated interventions. [105] The USI model is a comprehensive way of categorizing prevention efforts according to defined populations, and consists of: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal</strong> <strong>interventions</strong> designed to reach the whole population, without regard to population target groups or risk factors; </li>
<li><strong>Selective</strong> <strong>interventions</strong> are designed to focus on groups who have been identified as at high risk for suicide-related behaviours; and </li>
<li><strong>Indicated interventions</strong> are designed for individuals showing signs of suicide-related _<br>This immediately made me think of my explicit/implicit intervention model. My ‘implicit interventions’ are universal interventions (though stealthy), ‘explicit interventions’ are selective interventions, and the one-on-one interventions that Mark asked me about would be indicated interventions. The conversion isn’t perfect: public health scientists think about ‘the population’ whereas in education we could be thinking about a classroom, a department, a programme, all the kids in grade 8 across a country, etc – our ‘population’ is flexible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The fascinating thing for me is the analysis of universal interventions – which the report lauds as being be more effective, and cites meta-analyses finding universal interventions being generally be more effective than selective interventions.</p>
<p>Digging through the public health literature on USI, this certainly seems to be a trend. Selective interventions can do good work, but universal interventions seem to go that extra mile.</p>
<h2 id="A-USI-Model-for-Diversity-Initiatives-in-Education"><a href="#A-USI-Model-for-Diversity-Initiatives-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="A USI Model for Diversity Initiatives in Education"></a>A USI Model for Diversity Initiatives in Education</h2><p>After spending my afternoon reading public health papers using the USI model, I’d say the way I now think about diversity initiatives takes this form:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Universal interventions</strong> are intended to affect a whole body of students (or professionals, etc), such as a whole classroom or a whole degree programme. Universal interventions make change in an educational system in a way that disproportionately benefits underrepresented groups, but also has a positive or neutral effect on dominant groups. Examples include:</p>
</li>
<li><p>A whole CS classroom using pair-programming</p>
</li>
<li>Blind review for conferences</li>
<li><p>Everybody has to take some CS*   <strong>Selective interventions</strong> target a population known to be underrepresented in computer science (e.g. women, people of colour, low-SES, etc), are offered specifically and explicitly to that group, and provides them with targeted support to ‘level the playing field’ with dominant groups in CS. Examples include:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Women in CS conferences/celebrations</p>
</li>
<li>Outreach events for girls*   <strong>Indicated interventions</strong> are individual-level interventions – such as a teacher or professor taking the time to give extra encouragement to a student to study (or stay in) CS.<br>All three types of interventions can have positive impacts on diversity in CS. One-on-one encouragement is, for example, <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2014/02/why-are-there-so-few-black-and-hispanic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strong indicator of whether black students will take CS</a>. And supportive communities like Grace Hopper can help women find a place in the CS community.</li>
</ul>
<p>But like in public health, universal interventions can make the widest changes on a population-level at a lesser cost. Not every student interested in CS can (or will be) reached by selective/indicated interventions. It would be infeasible to get CS outreach efforts to reach every single girl, kid of colour, kid of low SES, etc – “<a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/educational-technology-as-imperialism-finding-a-middle-ground-between-papert-and-freire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[w]e need [to get CS into] school in order to reach everyone.</a>“</p>

        <p>A few weeks back, I attended ICER 2013 at UC San Diego. Afterwards, I  went up to San Francisco and had some adventures there (and at  Yosemite), and then spent time in Vancouver seeing friends before coming  home.</p>
<p>ICER this year was a solid conference, as  always. I liked that this year things reverted to having two minute  roundtable discussions after every talk, before the Q&amp;A. It makes  for a much more engaging conference.</p>
<p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LV7rcg0s_wM/UiKY8j0noOI/AAAAAAAAAkM/bOSQ3Wp0hWY/s1600/de-saint-phalle-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LV7rcg0s_wM/UiKY8j0noOI/AAAAAAAAAkM/bOSQ3Wp0hWY/s320/de-saint-phalle-01.jpg" alt=""></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">All hail the UCSD Sun God, who benevolently oversaw the conference.</td></tr></tbody></table>My favourite talk this year was definitely Tom Park et al’s “<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493405&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Towards a taxonomy of errors in HTML/CSS</a>“.  HTML/CSS tends not to get studied in the CS ed crowd, and as Tom’s talk  illustrated, that’s a big shame. HTML is for many people the first (and  sometimes only) formal language that they encounter.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It turns out that many of the same stumbling blocks that people have when learning programming languages are <em>the same</em> as when they learn HTML. Syntax errors, figuring inconsistent syntax,  learning that things need to be consistent – even just learning that  what you see is not what you get.</p>
<p>In compsci we tend to  overlook teaching HTML since it’s a markup language, not a programming  language. But what we deal with in compsci is <em>formal languages</em>,  and the simplest ones are the markup languages. Playing with a markup  language is actually a much simpler place to start than giving novices a  fully-fledged, Turing complete language.</p>
<p>Other research talks of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Hubwieser et al presented a paper on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493395&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">categorizing PCK in computer science</a> that I liked; I’d love to see more work on <a href="http://mkoehler.educ.msu.edu/tpack/pedagogical-content-knowledge-pck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCK</a> in CS, and look forward to seeing subsequent work using their framework.</li>
<li>Colleen Lewis et al performed a <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493415&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replication study looking at AP CS exams</a>.  I love replication studies, so I may be a bit biased towards it :) In  the original paper, they found that the first AP CS exam’s scores were  strongly predicted by only a handful of questions – and those questions  were ones like:<tt><br><em>int p = 3<br>int q = 8<br>p = q<br>q = p</em></tt>_<br>what are the values of p and q?_<br>In  Colleen’s paper, they found that the newer AP CS exams are much more  balanced: things are not predicted by a small number of questions. Good  to see!</li>
<li>Robert McCartney et al <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493412&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revisited the famous McCraken study</a> that found that students can’t program after CS1, and found that  students can, but that educators have unrealistic expectations for what  students would know by the end of CS1.</li>
<li>Michelle Friend and Robert Cutler found <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493413&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that grade 8 students</a>,  when asked to write and evaluate search algorithms, favour a sentinel  search (go every 100 spots, then every 10, then then every 1 spots, etc)  over binary search.*   Mike Hewner found that <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493414&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS students pick their CS courses</a> with really no knowledge of what they’ll be learning in the class. It’s  one of those findings that’s kind of obvious in retrospect, but we  educators really tend to mistake our students as thinking they know what  they’re in for. Really, a student about to take a CS2 class doesn’t  know what “hash tables” or “graphs” are coming in. Students pick classes  more around who the prof is, the class’ reputation, and time of day.</li>
<li><p>Finally, <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493410&amp;CFID=242030508&amp;CFTOKEN=27792449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Lee et al found that providing assessments</a> improve how many levels people will play in an educational game that  teaches programming. It’s a neat paper, but the finding is kind of  predictable given <a href="http://rer.sagepub.com/content/77/1/81.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the literature on feedback</a> for students.</p>
<p>I much more enjoyed <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2016911.2016934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael’s ICER talk from two years ago</a>.  He found in the same educational game that the more the compiler was  personified, the more people played the game. Having a compiler that  gives emoticon-style facial expressions, and uses first person pronouns (<em>I think you missed a semi-colon vs. Missing semicolon</em>)  makes a dramatic difference in how much more people engage with  learning computing. That’s a fairly ground-breaking discovery and I  highly recommend the paper.<br>The conference, was of course, not only limited to research talks:</p>
</li>
<li><p>The doctoral consortium, as always, was a great experience. I got  good feedback, about a dozen things to read, as well as awesome  conference-buddies!</p>
</li>
<li>The lightning talks were neat. My favourite was Ed Knorr’s talk on  teaching fourth-year databases, since third-year and fourth-year CS  courses are so often overlooked in the CS ed community. I also liked  Kathi Fisler’s talk on using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-based_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outcome-based grading</a> in CS.</li>
<li>The discussion talks were interesting! Elena Glassman talked about  having students compare solution approaches in programming, which nicely  complements the <a href="http://coscostheta.blogspot.ca/2013/08/comparing-and-contrasting-algorithms-is.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work that I presented this year</a>.*   The keynote talk also talked about the importance of  comparing-and-contrasting. My takeaway from the keynote, however, was a  teaching tip. Scott, the speaker, found that students learnt more from  assignments if they were asked upon hand-in to grade themselves on the  assignment. (Students would basically get a bonus if their  self-assessment agreed with the TAs’ assessment.) It’s such a small  thing to add onto the hand-in process, and adds so much to how much  students get out of it. I’ll definitely have to try this next time I  teach.<br>Overall, a great time, and I’m looking forward to ICER 2014 in Glasgow!</li>

        <p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NET2tnpXIlg/UgRWQvHV3oI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Al8qX4gIUtA/s1600/Individual+vs+Team.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NET2tnpXIlg/UgRWQvHV3oI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Al8qX4gIUtA/s1600/Individual+vs+Team.jpg" alt=""></a>At today’s CS Education Reading Group, one of our group members led us through an exercise about group work from “<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1869566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Students’ cooperation in teamwork: binding the individual and the team interests</a>“ by Orit Hazzan and Yael Dubinsky.</p>
<p>It’s  an in-class activity to get students thinking about how they work  together in software projects. Students are given a scenario: you’ll be  on a software team. If the project completes early, the team gets a  bonus. How should the bonus be allocated?</p>
<ol>
<li>100% of the bonus should be shared equally<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NET2tnpXIlg/UgRWQvHV3oI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Al8qX4gIUtA/s1600/Individual+vs+Team.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
</a></div></li>
<li>80% should be for the team to share; 20% should go to the top contributor</li>
<li>50% team, 50% individual</li>
<li>80% team, 20% individual</li>
<li>0% team, 100% to the individual who contributed the most<a name="more"></a>Everybody in the room got a minute to say which  option we’d prefer and to write it down – and then we had a discussion  about it. We then went through the rest of Orit’s paper and the variant  scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was the sole person in the room arguing  for 100% team. My reasoning was because individual bonuses are not  effective rewards – and often counterproductive.</p>
<h3 id="Large-Monetary-Awards-are-Counterproductive"><a href="#Large-Monetary-Awards-are-Counterproductive" class="headerlink" title="Large Monetary Awards are Counterproductive"></a>Large Monetary Awards are Counterproductive</h3><p>Ariely et al found that larger monetary rewards actually <em>reduce</em> performance on cognitive, intellectual tasks (<a href="http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/2/451.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>).&nbsp; There’s almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half a century</a> of psychology research arguing this.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/53/6/674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it doesn’t just hold</a> in laboratory studies – though <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/66/6/1116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not as simple as in the lab</a>. Pay-for-performance approaches in the white-collar workplace have been repeatedly <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-005-5904-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=822866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be</a> <a href="http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/3/791.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least</a> <a href="http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/early/2013/02/15/mnsc.1120.1683.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suboptimal</a>. </p>
<p>External motivators <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/jep/2011/00000025/00000004/art00009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally don’t help</a> with cognitive tasks – internal motivation is really what drives us to do well on cognitive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="Bonuses-and-Justice"><a href="#Bonuses-and-Justice" class="headerlink" title="Bonuses and Justice"></a>Bonuses and Justice</h3><p>Another problem with bonuses is fairness. Women and a number of other minorities are <a href="http://sss.sagepub.com/content/42/2/307.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to get them</a>. They’re less likely to <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=rSsu2qpTcuMC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=3p0v5yod3-&amp;dq=women%20ask%20for%20promotions&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20ask%20for%20promotions&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue they deserve</a> them. Their contributions are more likely to be viewed as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4537.00234/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less important</a>. And they are perceived <a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/matilda.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as less valuable</a>.</p>
<p>(On that note, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2224143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping in restaurants</a> in the like is known to amplify racial inequalities. The <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2008/03/20/the-racial-tipping-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race of the server</a> is a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00338.x/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger predictor of gratuity size</a> than the quality of the service.)</p>
<h3 id="Student-Perceptions-of-Teamwork"><a href="#Student-Perceptions-of-Teamwork" class="headerlink" title="Student Perceptions of Teamwork"></a>Student Perceptions of Teamwork</h3><p>In Orit’s small-sized classes, students opted for 80% team, 20% individual (see her <a href="http://dl.acm.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/citation.cfm?id=961561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2003 ITiCSE paper</a>). Why not 100%? One of the things that came up in our discussion is the question “but who is on my team?”</p>
<p>For  a lot of our discussants, team composition was the driving factor. Do  you have a team you trust? Then 100% for the team, for sure. But what if  you don’t know them? Or you don’t trust them?</p>
<p>Katrina Falkner et al did a study on how CS students perceive collaborative activities, which they presented <a href="http://dl.acm.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/citation.cfm?id=2445196.2445268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at last year’s SIGCSE</a>.  For a lot of students, collaboration stresses them out: they’re not  used to it, they’re not experienced at it, and they’re not particularly  good at it. But as educators, that’s what we’re here to work on, right?</p>
<p>The  biggest source of anxiety for students in Katrina’s study was in who  their partners were/would be. Would their partner(s) be smart,  hardworking, and reliable?</p>
<h3 id="Team-Composition"><a href="#Team-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Team Composition"></a>Team Composition</h3><p>It turns out randomized groups were the worst for students. Students felt powerless over their performance. We know from <a href="http://jme.sagepub.com/content/30/4/557.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other literature</a> that randomized groups is suboptimal for student performance. A much  better way to form groups for performance is to group students by  ability – strong students with fellow strong students.</p>
<p>On  that note – it can be disastrous to pair strong students with weak  students on the idea that poor students learn from the weak ones. It  seeds/reinforces a lot of student fears about group work: strong  students dislike it as they have to do a disproportionate share of the  work; weak students learn less as their partner is doing the work for  them.</p>
<p>Moving on: the best way to form groups in terms  of reducing student anxiety is often to let students pick their groups. I  say “often” because for a student who feels like an odd-one-out in the  class, or doesn’t know anybody, this can be just as stressful. </p>
<h3 id="Managing-Short-Term-Stress"><a href="#Managing-Short-Term-Stress" class="headerlink" title="Managing Short Term Stress"></a>Managing Short Term Stress</h3><p>Stress is another thing worth talking  about. Some people do great under pressure, and work better with the  focus it gives them. And some people fall apart under stress, and work  best without pressure. (And most of us are somewhere in between.)</p>
<p>The good news is that how we interpret anxiety is fairly malleable, and in a good way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div itemprop="articleBody">_The first experiment was at Harvard University with undergraduates who  were studying for the Graduate Record Examination. Before taking a  practice test, the students read a short note explaining that the  study’s purpose was to examine the effects of stress on cognition. Half  of the students, however, were also given a statement declaring that  recent research suggests “people who feel anxious during a test might  actually do better.” Therefore, if the students felt anxious during the  practice test, it said, “you shouldn’t feel concerned. . . simply remind  yourself that your arousal could be helping you do well.”        _</div><div itemprop="articleBody"><em>Just reading this statement significantly improved students’  performance. They scored 50 points higher in the quantitative section  (out of a possible 800) than the control group on the practice test.&nbsp;</em></div><div itemprop="articleBody">– <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/magazine/why-can-some-kids-handle-pressure-while-others-fall-apart.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Can Some Kids Handle Stress While Others Fall Apart?</a> </div><br>Getting  that message out to students is something we ought to be doing – test  anxiety hurts a lot of student, as does anxiety about group work. It  doesn’t have to be so bad.</p>

        <p>In five days, I’ll be heading to <a href="http://icer.hosting.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICER 2013</a> in San Diego, where I’ll be presenting a paper “<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparing and Contrasting Different Algorithms Leads to Increased Student Learning</a>“ (<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Epatitsas/icer_2013_mscthesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf here</a>).</p>
<p>The  findings in a nutshell: if you present two different approaches to  solving a compsci problem side-by-side and have students compare them,  the students will understand the problem <em>better</em> than if you  present those approaches sequentially. And importantly, the students  will be better transferring their understanding of th<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FOD_a2CMuoQ/Uf_0Rh8-USI/AAAAAAAAAiY/c6tsV7LERNI/s1600/200px-Binary_search_tree.svg.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FOD_a2CMuoQ/Uf_0Rh8-USI/AAAAAAAAAiY/c6tsV7LERNI/s200/200px-Binary_search_tree.svg.png" alt=""></a>e problem to similar problems.</p>
<p>Why  is this notable? Because the sequential approach is pretty much ~95% of  how we teach algorithms and data structures! Just this past term when  teaching CS2 I did things this way: a unit on binary trees, then a unit  on BSTs, then a unit on heaps. Yet the evidence we have here is that  it’s better to show algorithms/data structure variation in parallel.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<h3 id="Background-Knowledge"><a href="#Background-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Background Knowledge"></a>Background Knowledge</h3><p>This study is a replication of two studies in math education –&nbsp; a <a href="http://itp.wceruw.org/Fall%2009%20seminar/Rittle-Johnson%26Star-07.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study on algebra problems</a>, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19147158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fol]low-up study on estimation problems</a>, both by Bethany Rittle-Johnson and Jon R. Star.</p>
<p>In the original algebra study, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>a control group where students were given workbooks that had  students saw a worked example solving a problem using one approach; they  answered questions about it; then <em>on the next page</em> they saw a second worked example solving the problem using a different approach, and answered questions about it</li>
<li><p>an experimental group where the workbooks presented the two worked examples <em>side-by-side</em> and students worked on all those problems <em>on the same page</em><br>The study has a pretest-intervention-posttest model,  where the pretest and posttest are the same test. This allows the  researchers to see how much students learnt from the intervention. The  tests probed three things:</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>procedural knowledge</strong> – how to solve a problem*   <strong>procedural flexibility</strong> – being able to solve a problem with multiple approaches; being able to generate, recognize and evaluate different approaches</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>conceptual knowledge</strong><br><em>And what did they find?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>the compare &amp; contrast group did <strong>better</strong> than the sequential group with respect to <u>procedural knowledge</u> and <u>procedural flexibility</u></p>
</li>
<li>the two groups <u>did the same on conceptual knowledge</u><br>The conceptual knowledge thing was a bit of a surprise to them. <em>So, they did another study!</em> This time, they did a prestest-intervention-posttest-followup study.  That’s the same as before, but with a second posttest given some time  after the study, to see how much students retain. In this study, the  math problems were about estimation. </li>
</ul>
<p>What did they find?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Again</em>, the compare and contrast group did <strong>better</strong> on the posttest and the follow-up with regard to <u>procedural knowledge</u> and <u>procedural flexibility</u></li>
<li><p>But again, the two groups are the same on <u>conceptual knowledge</u>.<br>It bothered them some more that the conceptual  knowledge was different. Some similar studies in other fields would lead  one to predict conceptual knowledge would be the same. So, they looked  closer at their data:</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the students who started off with <strong>some</strong> conceptual knowledge, the compare &amp; contrast condition lead to <u>more</u> learning.</p>
</li>
<li>For the students who had <strong>no</strong> conceptual knowledge to begin with, it <u>didn’t matter</u> which condition they were given.They speculated that you need to have some existing knowledge of a problem for comparing and contrasting to really shine.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Our-study"><a href="#Our-study" class="headerlink" title="Our study"></a>Our study</h4><p>We ran our study as a  pretest-intervention-posttest-followup study, following the estimation  study. In our study, CS2 students compared different techniques for  hashing. We ran the study in three different sections of CSC 148 at  UToronto, with 241 students participating.</p>
<p>Not that  surprisingly, students in the compare-and-contrast group performed  better at procedural knowledge and procedural flexibility – and the two  groups performed the same on conceptual knowledge.</p>
<p>But we found the <em>opposite</em> of Rittle-Johnson and Star when we looked closer at conceptual knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>students who started with _no_ conceptual knowledge gained <strong>more</strong> from the compare-and-contrast condition than from the sequential condition</li>
<li>students who started with <em>some</em> conceptual knowledge performed the <strong>same</strong> in both conditions<br>What we think is going on here is that the compare-and-contrast approach lets students build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_%28psychology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schema</a>. <strong>By looking at what is different and similar, they can decipher what the important aspects of a problem are.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>For  the students who already have such a schema in place, when they see  things sequentially, they can relate things back to their schema. They  already know what the important aspects of a problem are, and so can  compare on the fly.</p>
<p>For an expert like me, or any other  instructor, this is the same for us. When I look at a hash function, I  already know the aspects of hashing that can be varied to solve problems  differently. When I see something new presented, I can relate it back  to what I already know.</p>
<p>Another difference comes with yardsticks. Experts work with yardsticks  like big O  notation and complexity classes – that allow us to scale up our  knowledge very easily. For novices, it’s a lot easier to handle  “mergesort is faster than selection sort” than “mergesort is O(nlgn)”.</p>
<p>For  us experts, it makes sense to present information sequentially –  because we can easily process things that way. For our students – the  ones learning things completely afresh – <strong>that’s a <em>lot</em> harder</strong>.</p>
