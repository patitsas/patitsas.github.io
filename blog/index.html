        <p>In the past year, I’ve been finding ways to infuse Disability Studies into the education courses I teach. Since a few friends and colleagues have asked me for advice on how to infuse a week or two of disability-related content into their syllabi, I thought I’d share what I’ve learnt so far for any other educators out there looking to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="The-three-biggest-things-I’ve-learnt"><a href="#The-three-biggest-things-I’ve-learnt" class="headerlink" title="The three biggest things I’ve learnt:"></a>The three biggest things I’ve learnt:</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Students really have no clue how bad discrimination is toward people with disabilities</strong> (e.g. forced sterilization, subminimum wage, immigration restrictions, removal of children, lack of sex ed, higher rates of violence and abuse and sexual violence)</li>
<li><strong>It is new and alien for them to think about disability pride</strong></li>
<li><strong>They are not used to hearing disability voices at all</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>As such I recommend any introduction to disability studies start with addressing these, especially from an intersectional lens. Pretty much of the ways in which ableism is accepted and reinforced in society disproportionately affect multiply-marginalized disabled people (e.g. black disabled people, trans disabled people) and that needs to be reinforced.</p>
<h2 id="Recommendations-for-Readings"><a href="#Recommendations-for-Readings" class="headerlink" title="Recommendations for Readings"></a>Recommendations for Readings</h2><p>I’d start by thinking about how you can take existing topics in your syllabus and relate them to disability justice. For example, let’s say you’ve been teaching about critical race studies. You could then talk about the intersections of race and disability, such as how special education as we know it was created to ensure racial segregation after <em>Brown v Board</em>. Or, let’s say you’re teaching a course about the sociology of science; you could get into issues of eugenics or the relationships between disability and technology. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Since students tend not to have any background in disability studies, here are a minimal set of readings I’d suggest to start with. Only one is an academic reading; and other than it and a 45min podcast, they are all quite short. All of these should be accessible to an undergraduate audience.</p>
<p>If you only have one week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stella Young: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9Gg164Bsw&amp;list=PLw7uuf2mbzzHFxLIy8Lv8bpp3YRkJw2Mr&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m not your inspiration</a> (~10 min video, has captions)<ul>
<li>Introduces social model of disability, inspiration porn, critique of how education system deals with disability, disability community</li>
<li><em>I generally hate TED talks but this one has proven effective! Heard students returning to it a bunch during small group activities.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Center for Disability Rights’ <a href="http://cdrnys.org/disability-writing-journalism-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disability Writing &amp; Journalism Guidelines</a> (~15 min read)<ul>
<li>Resource on language to use about disability; good/bad disability organizations</li>
<li>Introduces ableism, disability community, intersectionality</li>
<li><em>If you’re assigning the Stella Young video, I’d order things so this comes after so it reinforces her speech. You can make this one optional but I recommend having it posted so it’s a resource available about what language is appropriate.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harriet Tubman Collective’s open letter: <a href="http://www.forharriet.com/2016/09/the-vision-for-black-lives-is.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vision for Black Lives is Incomplete Without Disability Solidarity</a> (~10 min read)<ul>
<li>Note: “audism” is discrimination toward the Deaf community</li>
<li>Introduction to the issues at the intersection of race and disability</li>
<li>Overview of some of the ways that disabled people today continue to be oppressed</li>
<li><em>I have students who are already supporters of BLM. Might think about a different reading introducing race+disability intersections if you’re worried about students being anti-BLM.</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rose Eveleth in Wired: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-to-rethink-whos-best-suited-for-space-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s Time to Rethink Who’s Best Suited for Space Travel</a> (~10 min read)<ul>
<li>Introduces some of the ways in which disability is advantageous</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a second class, or assign more than an hour of reading each class, add:</p>
<ol>
<li>99% Invisible podcast episode <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Curb Cuts”</a> (~45 mins, has transcript)<ul>
<li>Introduction to the history of disability rights movement in the US; Ed Roberts and the Rolling Quads</li>
<li>Introduction to curb cuts, universal design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 2, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZmTjsgLRDUCyJCQufw627Oi8d-FG28el/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Social Construction of Disability”</a>; from Wendell, Susan. The rejected body: Feminist philosophical reflections on disability. Routledge, 2013. (~40 min read)<ul>
<li>Introduces how disability is socially constructed</li>
<li>Discusses intersections of disability and sex/gender</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Olga Khazan in The Atlantic: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/when-hearing-voices-is-a-good-thing/374863/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When Hearing Voices is a Good Thing</a> (~5 min read)<ul>
<li>Describes how schizophrenia symptoms vary culturally - helps reinforce how disability is socially constructed</li>
<li>Also presents people who are happy to have schizophrenia and don’t see it as a bad thing - helps reinforce disability pride</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re worried about there being too much in the second week, I would switch either the 99pi episode to week 1 and then move the CDR writing guidelines to week 2. And then from there add readings relevant to things you’ve already talked about in your course!</p>
<h3 id="Selecting-Relevant-Readings-To-Your-Course"><a href="#Selecting-Relevant-Readings-To-Your-Course" class="headerlink" title="Selecting Relevant Readings To Your Course"></a>Selecting Relevant Readings To Your Course</h3><p>If you don’t already have some relevant readings in mind, or don’t feel confident about the ones you’re thinking of, I would do a google scholar search for <code>&quot;ableism&quot; + (relevant topical keywords)</code>. </p>
<p>I would steer away from searching for <code>&quot;disability&quot; + your relevant topical keywords</code> because of how much ableist content there is out there. Talking about ableism is a decent shibboleth to gauge DS background.</p>
<p>You may also want to have a skim through the table of contents for Lennard &amp; Davis’ Disability Studies Reader (<a href="https://www.dventura.com:9443/cops/library/Lennard%20J.%20Davis/The%20Disability%20Studies%20Reader%20%28106%29/The%20Disability%20Studies%20Reader%20-%20Lennard%20J.%20Davis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf</a>). There’s a ton of classic articles in there and the TOC usefully gives short descriptions of each. You’re also welcome to <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~patitsas/cds/#intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peruse my annotated Disability Studies syllabus here</a>!</p>
<h2 id="Class-Activity"><a href="#Class-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Class Activity"></a>Class Activity</h2><p>In class I have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wj92lSESLR7MKcPSsUnXuXeEeH0oLsQA4y45p8vFZnI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set of slides</a> in which I discuss current disability rights/justice issues, different models of disability, and disability pride. When I presented these slides in winter 2019, it took me 37 minutes to go through them; I gave a more streamlined version in fall 2018 that took 20 mins.</p>
<p>I then do a class activity wherein for multiple disabilities I ask students in group questions like “How does society marginalize people with this disability?” and “Why would somebody with this disability feel proud to have it?”. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tidSsNd4uHO1f8AxEJXZefYY58HIFoDxFE86vBHKI_s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The worksheet is here and takes about an hour (~10 mins a question)</a>. If you want to shorten it, I would assign 2-3 disabilities out of the five there, but vary which groups get which disabilities. You can get it down to 20-30 mins this way.</p>
<p>Before the worksheet I work through two worked examples: deafness and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Students struggle the most with why somebody would be proud, so be prepared for that! After the students have worked through the sheet I have groups share their responses to that question because I know that’s what they tended to struggle with.</p>
<h3 id="My-Experiences-With-This"><a href="#My-Experiences-With-This" class="headerlink" title="My Experiences With This"></a>My Experiences With This</h3><ul>
<li>Each time I’ve taught this (slides+activity), I’ve opened with asking people to list some disabilities and categories of disabilities<ul>
<li>“Mental” vs “physical” always seems to be the first thing, and I have to do some work showing how that dichotomy breaks down</li>
<li>Students typically expect there’s a definition of disability, or expect there to be agreement on what it is. So they ask questions like “is X a disability?” and I have to explain that it depends on who you ask. <ul>
<li>If you’re pressed for time and don’t want to really dive into social constructionism, you might start with the WHO definition and discuss some of its limitations — but at the same time I think it’s important to make clear there is no agreed upon definition</li>
<li>Students often stuck on how chronic illness is disabling, and how the dichotomy between illness and disability is also a broken one</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first time I taught a lesson disability studies I didn’t spend any time justifying why disability matters as a lens. Second time I put in a little slide listing some of the legal forms of discrimination against PWD and the students were <em>shocked</em>. Third time I did even more. </li>
<li>I’ve learnt to do EDS as a worked example because students don’t know what it is. An earlier version of the worksheet had more disabilities available (I had a bunch of strips of paper and randomized which groups got what) but we were slowed down since many of the disabilities students had never even heard of before.</li>
<li>Working through some examples of what the social model entails and having students work through some more appears to be effective for getting their heads around the social model.<ul>
<li>Students often get stuck on the difference between social model and social construction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I’ve gotten consistently positive feedback for including disability studies in my teaching — students appreciate learning about it!</li>
</ul>

        <p>One of the challenges of studying equity in computing is that while there is a lot of work on the subject, the topic lacks the infrastructure of a well-established (sub)field. For example, when I was a PhD student studying for my qualifying exam, there was not a pre-established list of texts for me to study. When students and colleagues ask me for readings on equity in CS I tend to start from scratch each time, and will miss things.</p>
<p>To solve these issues, I’ve put together a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/criticalCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading list on critical prespectives on equity in computing</a>. The list is heavily annotated for guidance, and importanty covers foundational texts in areas that a criticial approach to computing equity should draw on (e.g. critical pedagogy, Science and Technology Studies, Gender Work &amp; Organization, critical disability studies, critical race studies).</p>
<p>I welcome feedback on the list. Hopefully you’ll find it useful!</p>

        <p>Theories from psychology enjoy a fair bit of use in computer science education, but education is not merely a cognitive process: it’s also a social one.</p>
<p>I’ve found it useful to learn about social theory as a CS education graduate student, and I thought I’d share a quick introduction to social theory that I initially wrote for my research proposal to my thesis committee this fall.</p>
<h3 id="Classical-Social-Theory"><a href="#Classical-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Classical Social Theory"></a>Classical Social Theory</h3><p>Classically, sociology has had four major schools of thought, each of which goes by various names and is associated with one of the four “founders” of sociology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Auguste Comte</strong> (1798-1857) coined the term “positive philosophy”, now better known as positivism. Comte’s sociology was inspired by the French Revolution: sociology was envisioned as a means to produce the perfect society. (Indeed, Comte was incensed that the lower classes wouldn’t simply accept their “place” in society.)<br>In Comte’s world, one would test out different ideas for how to run a society, and find the optimal approach. While Comte himself argued for holism, (post)positivism has since come to be associated with reductionism.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sociology of <strong>Max Weber </strong>(1864-1920) contrasts with Comte’s: Weber was a proponent of anti-positivism  (also known as constructivism or interpretivism). Weber saw <em>verstehen</em> (understanding) as the goal of research, rather than hypothesis verification. Weber theorized upon social stratification; he also wrote about closure (how groups draw the boundaries and construct identities, and compete with out-group members for scarce resources.)</p>
<p>Weber’s sociology put an emphasis on ideology. Capitalism, for example, was the result of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICppFQ6Tabw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideological conditions unique to Northern Europe</a>; capitalism has only succeeded where these ideological conditions hold.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emile Durkheim</strong> (1858-1917) built on Comte’s positivism, setting forth <em>structural functionalism</em>. In structural functionalism, a society is viewed like a biological cell: different parts of a society are likened organelles. Durkheim’s sociology looks at how the parts work together to comprise the whole. It is also holistic – much of how systems thinking was used in the social sciences built on Durkheimian notions of society.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>Karl Marx </strong>(1818-1883) provided an approach which contrasts with Durkheim’s: instead of seeing harmony, it emphasizes the role of class conflict in society and the historical-economic basis thereof. Marxist sociology has also been known as <em>conflict theory</em>, though the historical-economic basis is not the only way one could study conflict. For example, Weberians see conflict rooted in ideology, rather than in a clash over resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="20th-Century-Social-Theory"><a href="#20th-Century-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="20th Century Social Theory"></a>20th Century Social Theory</h3><p>While classical theory is often referred to in terms of thinkers (Marx, Weber, etc), the more modern movements tend to be known more by schools of thought. Some of the major ones would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Neo-Marxism</strong> refers to the 20th century updates of Marxist theory, which  has pulled in Weberian and poststructuralist work on status and power.  Antonio Gramsci is a well-known neo-Marxist, who was curious about the  question of why the revolution Marx had predicted never seemed to come about. Gramsci is most famous for his theory of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cHThwyA8RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural hegemony</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical theory</strong> is also based on Marxist thought, and is often conflated with it. Critical theory emphasizes <em>praxis</em>, the combination of theory and practice. Critical theory is most associated with the Frankfurt School, including names such as Theodor Adorno and Jurgen Habermas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interactionism</strong> assumes that all social processes are the result of human interaction. It emerged in the early 20th century. Interactionaists focus their studies on the interactions between individuals. As a result, interactionists do not `see’ the effects of physical environment – or even solitary thought/work. They also reject quantitative data in favour of qualitative approaches: grounded theory and ethnomethodology were both developed by interactionists. The notion of social interaction as a performance was first developed in interactionist thought; poststructuralists have since refined it. While there’s no single name associated with this perspective, some associated names include George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, and Dorothy Smith.<br>Sociologists also look at social systems at different levels: the <em>macro</em> level looks at entire societies, nations, etc; the <em>meso</em> level looks at organizations, institutions, etc; the <em>micro</em> level looks at individuals. While classical sociology was generally macro, interactionism focuses on the micro level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Structuralism</strong> might be seen as a macro-focused backlash against interactionism’s focus on the micro. Structuralism sees social processes as stemming from larger, overarching structures, and also emerged in the early 20th century. Structuralists see society as being governed by these structures in a somewhat analogous fashion to how physicists may see the universe as being governed by laws of nature. A criticism of structuralism is that it sees these structures as fixed; in contrast a Marxist would focus on historical change. Some structuralists include Claude Levi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, and Jean Piaget.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Poststructuralism</strong> (more or less interchangeable with “postmodernism”) is not a particularly coherent school of thought. This is not altogether surprising as the key poststructuralists both reject the label and the very notion that there is such a real thing as poststructuralism. Poststructuralists reject the idea of “objective” knowledge: since the study of sociology is done by humans who are biased by history and culture, they argue that any study of a social phenomenon must be combined with how the study of that social phenomenon was produced. For example, a poststructuralist would not take a concept like `gender’ as a given, but problematize the concept. Poststructuralism evolved out of structuralism in the mid 20th century. Some major poststructuralists include Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler.</li>

        <p>I’ve been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bourdieu</a> kick for the course I’m currently taking on social theory (LHA 1803Y: Theory in Higher Education), and since <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Easterbrook</a> mentioned he wasn’t familiar with Bourdieu, I figured I’d write a quick and dirty introduction to Bourdieu’s social theories. Steve’s a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416545842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+in+systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems thinker</a> so this is written for such an audience.</p>
<p>In systems thinking we like to think of people as existing in many (overlapping) social <em>systems</em> (because, after all, pretty much everything to a systems thinker is a system.) These social systems can be things like school, work, a professional community, or even your favourite internet community.</p>
<p>Bourdieu would call those systems <em>fields</em>. (Specifically, a field is a system of social positions, with internal structure.) In his terminology, the rules determining the system/fields are known as <em>nomos</em>. (Fields are not the same as class, which I’ll get to later.) When people in fields ‘play by the rules’ of the system, and invest in it, he calls this <em>illusio.</em></p>
<p>If you’re wondering if he also has paradigms in his systems, the answer is yes! He calls them <em>doxa</em>, the concepts and ideas which go without saying as it comes without saying – “the universe of possible discourse”.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="Individuals"><a href="#Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Individuals"></a>Individuals</h2><p>As an individual, I interact with numerous fields. There are two things that matter about me in how I interact with these fields: my capital, and my <em>habitus.</em></p>
<p>Bourdieu distinguishes numerous forms of capital:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>economic capital</em>, how many financial assets I have</li>
<li><em>social capital</em>, who I know, my social networks, what I can get out them, etc.</li>
<li><em>cultural capital</em>, the knowledge, skills, advantages and education that I have – along with the cultural ‘know-how’ of how to navigate particular social situations</li>
<li><em>symbolic capital</em>, the resources available to me on the basis of honour, prestige, recognition, or my other forms of capitalA thing worth noting about capital is that its value is context-dependent. For example, my knowledge of Star Trek trivia (which is cultural capital), has use in nerdy fields like computer science, but less so at gatherings of my extended family. Similarly, my Canadian money is of lesser value outside of Canada, and even less value were I to visit a society with a bartering or gift-giving economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for <em>habitus</em>, the description on Wikipedia wraps it up nicely: “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_%28sociology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the habitus </a>could be understood as a structure of the mind characterized by a set of acquired schemata, sensibilities, dispositions and taste”. Your habitus is developed in part through socialization. Bourdieu conceived of habitus as a way to study the interaction area between individual and society – in software engineering terms you might think of your habitus as being the coupler between an individual and society.</p>
<p>Every individual has a habitus – but likeminded individuals together can have group habitus. For example, a <em>class habitus</em> would refer to sensibilities, dispositions, tastes and ways of thinking about the world that are common to a social class. </p>
<h2 id="Class"><a href="#Class" class="headerlink" title="Class"></a>Class</h2><p>Unlike previous social theorists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weber</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marx</a>, Bourdieu’s view of class is not based on just economic capital, but instead on all capital (social, cultural, economic, symbolic). For me this is an appeal of Bourdieu: it explains why a ‘blue collar’ tradesman making the same amount of money as a ‘white collar’ adjunct are not really the same class.</p>
<p>Much of Bourdieu’s work looks at the reproduction of social inequality. He identifies feedback loops (though not by name) of what keeps the classes separate – and cultural capital plays a major role. How much cultural capital a person has, and to what social standing they are born, are determine their social mobility.</p>
<p>Those with a large amount of cultural capital in society are able to determine <em>taste</em> in society – such as what is low-brow vs. high brow (and everything in between). And people judge other people based on taste – does somebody ‘fit’ into a particular field? When people don’t fit in to a particular field, <em>symbolic violence</em> is used to keep them out or make them feel uncomfortable. Symbolic violence (also known as symbolic power) comprises things like implicit biases, microaggressions, de facto discrimination, and all that other lovely stuff that’s used to “keep them in their place”.</p>
<p>Symbolic violence allows for the reproduction of social divisions. A kid growing up in a working class family is going to have less access to means of accumulating cultural capital, is more likely to be affected by class dispositions to not value education as highly, and is more likely to say and do things when interacting with intellectuals that make them stick out like a sore thumb. Indeed, Bourdieu focuses extensively on the little things that stop people (or allow people) to accumulate capital – what they wear, the things they say, the hobbies they have – for him it’s all about the gain on the feedback loops here. The word ‘accumulation’ tends to come up a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><p>The stories women have of not feeling like they belong in tech/CS are the type of thing very amenable to a Bourdieusian analysis. Indeed, his early work focused on how the French university system amplified social inequalities (both in terms of gender and of class – and the intersection of the two, well before the term _intersectionality _took off).</p>
<p>His work has been used quite a bit by sociologists to look at the reproduction of social inequalities – for example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21133/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> used Bourdieu to examine how low-income minority ethnic groups feel alienated when they go to science museums – and why they don’t really go to them in the first place (hint: <em>habitus</em> plays a role – they have not been socially conditioned to see museums as a thing worth going to).</p>
<p>In many ways Bourdieu was a systems thinker – he thought of feedback loops, systems-within-systems, and systems-level behaviours, structures, rules and paradigms – but did not have the systems thinking vocabulary available to him. While he was active at the same time as the Systems Thinkers in the English-speaking world, few Systems Thinking based books have been translated into French – and most of the translations happened after Bourdieu died in 2002 (for example, Limits to Growth <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Limites-croissance-dans-monde-fini/dp/291777035X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416549088&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=donella+meadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t translated into French until 2012</a>!)</p>

<p>By all means, this fear isn’t the entire basis behind homophobia – but it’s a side of it I hadn’t thought of before. The comic that she posted is based loosely on a series of articles by <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2012/03/28/the-terror-of-catcalling-ctd-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Sullivan</a>, including this tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You struck a nerve with this one [article],  as I was just discussing this very thing a few weeks ago with a group  of high-school freshmen in my English class. We were discussing  homosexuality because of an allusion to it in the book we were reading,  and several boys made comments such as, “That’s disgusting.” We got into  the debate and eventually a boy admitted that he was  terrified/disgusted when he was once sharing a taxi and the other male  passenger made a pass at him.</em><br>_<br>__The lightbulb went off. “Oh,” I said. “I get it. See, you are afraid,  because for the first time in your life you have found yourself a  victim of unwanted sexual advances by someone who has the physical  ability to use force against you.” The boy nodded and shuddered visibly._&gt; <em>“But,” I continued. “As a woman, you learn to live with  that from the time you are fourteen, and it never stops. We live with  that fear every day of our lives. Every man walking through the parking  garage the same time you are is either just a harmless stranger or a  potential rapist. Every time.”</em><br><em>The girls in the room nodded, agreeing. The boys seemed genuinely shocked.</em><br>_<br>“So think about that the next time you hit on a girl. Maybe, like you in the taxi, she doesn’t actually want you to.” _</p>
