        <p>Many studies of women in STEM use men as a referent group to women: <em>how do women compare to men in CS with regard to retention, attitudes, discrimination, etc</em>? While there’s certainly benefit to using men as a referent group (and it’s far, far better than no referent group at all), there’s a threat to validity that we tend to overlook when studying women in CS: <strong>how much of what we see is an artifact of CS culture versus that of our wider society? **</strong><br>**<br>Triangulation using different referent groups is a good way to get around this issue. I’ve talked before about differences <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/10/why-are-there-more-women-in-some-stem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between women in CS vs. other STEM fields</a>, differences <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/10/why-are-there-more-women-in-cs-in-other.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between women in CS between different cultures</a>, and differences over <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/11/women-in-cs-historical-perspective.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>/<a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/11/generational-differences-for-female.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generations</a>. But in every one of these posts, I’ve really only looked at <em>scientists</em>. </p>
<p>Glass et al’s “<a href="http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/2/723.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What’s So Special about STEM? A Comparison of Women’s Retention in STEM and Professional Occupations</a>“ addresses another angle: what’s different for women in STEM vs. women in other professional occupations? After all, women are more likely than men to leave other professional occupations such as business, medicine and law [1]. And in all these fields, substantial problems remain at the top: women may make up a substantial proportion of workers, but a tiny minority of those running the show.</p>
<h3 id="The-Glass-et-al-Paper"><a href="#The-Glass-et-al-Paper" class="headerlink" title="The Glass et al Paper"></a>The Glass et al Paper</h3><p>To make the comparison of STEM women and non-STEM women, the Glass et al paper uses longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The longitudinal approach is a strength of the paper. A weakness, however, is that the women participating are a single generational cohort who entered the workforce in the late 80s/90s: <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/11/generational-differences-for-female.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“second generation”</a> per my previous post.</p>
<p>Overall, Glass et al found that <strong>women in STEM jobs had more in common with women  in non-STEM professional jobs</strong> – and that “few differences in job characteristics  emerge” overall. This is a rather important finding – it means that if we work  carefully, we can often generalize findings about women in the general  workforce to women in the STEM workforce.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>I say “carefully” since there were a few differences that they found. Here’s what’s unique to STEM women:</p>
<ol>
<li>Women who are married to fellow STEM workers are nearly <em><strong>100% more likely</strong></em> to stay in their STEM jobs than women married to non-STEM workers.2.  A higher education <em>does not</em> increase a STEM woman’s  likelihood of staying in a STEM career. In other occupations, such as  medicine or law, the more advanced degrees a woman has, the more likely  she’ll stay in the field. Glass et al attribute to this to the type of  work done by those with MSc/PhDs: the more education you need to do the  job, the more likely it’ll be isolating and in a “noxious” work  environment for women.</li>
<li>Unlike non-STEM women who leave their jobs to stay at home, when STEM women leave their jobs, they overwhelmingly do so <strong><em>to fill non-STEM jobs</em></strong>,  rather than to stay at home permanently. Switching to  management explains almost a quarter of these job departures.Those three differences aside, everything they looked at turned out to be the same for both STEM women and non-STEM women. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Similarities-between-female-STEM-and-non-STEM-workers"><a href="#Similarities-between-female-STEM-and-non-STEM-workers" class="headerlink" title="Similarities between female STEM and non-STEM workers"></a>Similarities between female STEM and non-STEM workers</h3><p>For both women in STEM jobs and women in professional non-STEM jobs, the  following things are positively correlated with the retention of women  in the workplace: Higher pay, job commitment, higher reported  job satisfaction, longer time working in that career, and the presence  of parental leave. </p>
<p>Sociologists have documented the “<a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/The%20Work-Family%20Narrative%20as%20a%20Social%20Defense_7f295d01-c861-4b3b-9534-747def995458.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work-Family Narrative</a>“ – the cultural narrative that women leave (or struggle with) their jobs because they can’t balance work and family. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0432.00022/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They’ve similarly documented</a> that the majority of workplace interventions to improve the status of women focus on this narrative.</p>
<p>Yet, what Glass et al found is that primary propellant of women out of the workforce – both STEM and non-STEM – is <em>not</em> childcare. Nor is it lack of confidence or lack of training – or lack  of “leaning in”.</p>
<p>The primary propellants are dissatisfaction with pay  and promotion prospects. <a href="http://org.sagepub.com/content/19/4/507.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2011.00566.x/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7+December+from+10%3A00-15%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-10%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a</a> <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton</a> <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZcdnuidRXcQC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=P1tKZqBdrf&amp;dq=preston%202004%20leaving%20science&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=preston%202004%20leaving%20science&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="http://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/upload/WilliamsAmScientist-3-2012-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sociology</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187911300119X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">papers</a> <a href="http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/8/2/161.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out</a> <a href="http://documents.library.nsf.gov/edocs/HD6060-.A84-2008-PDF-Athena-factor-Reversing-the-brain-drain-in-science,-engineering,-and-technology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0432.00022/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding</a> <a href="http://rca.ucsd.edu/speeches/Science_Supply_and_Demand_for_Scientists_and_Engineers__A_National_Crisis_in_the_Making_042790.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar</a> <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/The%20Work-Family%20Narrative%20as%20a%20Social%20Defense_7f295d01-c861-4b3b-9534-747def995458.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results</a>. Childcare might be the catalyst for acting on that dissatisfaction, but it’s not the underlying cause.</p>
<p>This dissatisfaction is linked to a number of sources of inequality, such as being left out of the “boys networks”, <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/11/correspondence-tests-uncovering-biases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subconscious biases against women</a>, open prejudice about the competence of women, and sexual harassment. Correspondence studies of women in STEM and other professional domains have consistently found that women are less likely to be thought worth of a promotion as an equally qualified man, less worthy of a higher salary, and less likable overall. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/organization/latest_thinking/unlocking_the_full_potential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And there’s evidence</a> that men in our society are promoted based on potential – while women are promoted based on past accomplishments. This sort of unintentional, <em>de facto</em> discrimination is not unique to STEM.</p>
<h3 id="The-Work-Family-Narrative-as-a-Social-Defense"><a href="#The-Work-Family-Narrative-as-a-Social-Defense" class="headerlink" title="The Work-Family Narrative as a Social Defense"></a>The Work-Family Narrative as a Social Defense</h3><p>The paper I linked to about the “Work-Family Narrative” – by Padravic and Ely – presents a rather compelling argument that the reason that people focus on this narrative is because it is an unconscious social defense. The Work-Family Narrative gives a way of thinking about the problems facing women in the professional workplace that doesn’t involve coming to terms with discrimination and systematic problems in the workforce.</p>
<p>Padravic and Ely also argue that this narrative similarly allows people to keep their cultural stereotypes in tact: women are the caregivers, men are the workers – and so women have a hard time in the workforce because they must balance their position as caregiver. I’ve noted before that our brains are <a href="http://patitsas.blogspot.ca/2013/11/subtyping-subgrouping-and-stereotype.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wired to keep cultural stereotypes in tact</a>.</p>
<p>Discrimination is an ugly thing to talk about. I don’t blame people for shying away from it. But it needs to be tackled to change the numbers of women in the workforce – whether it be STEM or other fields. And it’s important to compare STEM to the rest of society – we need to know what’s a STEM problem and what’s even more systematic.</p>

        <p>Theories from psychology enjoy a fair bit of use in computer science education, but education is not merely a cognitive process: it’s also a social one.</p>
<p>I’ve found it useful to learn about social theory as a CS education graduate student, and I thought I’d share a quick introduction to social theory that I initially wrote for my research proposal to my thesis committee this fall.</p>
<h3 id="Classical-Social-Theory"><a href="#Classical-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Classical Social Theory"></a>Classical Social Theory</h3><p>Classically, sociology has had four major schools of thought, each of which goes by various names and is associated with one of the four “founders” of sociology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Auguste Comte</strong> (1798-1857) coined the term “positive philosophy”, now better known as positivism. Comte’s sociology was inspired by the French Revolution: sociology was envisioned as a means to produce the perfect society. (Indeed, Comte was incensed that the lower classes wouldn’t simply accept their “place” in society.)<br>In Comte’s world, one would test out different ideas for how to run a society, and find the optimal approach. While Comte himself argued for holism, (post)positivism has since come to be associated with reductionism.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sociology of <strong>Max Weber </strong>(1864-1920) contrasts with Comte’s: Weber was a proponent of anti-positivism  (also known as constructivism or interpretivism). Weber saw <em>verstehen</em> (understanding) as the goal of research, rather than hypothesis verification. Weber theorized upon social stratification; he also wrote about closure (how groups draw the boundaries and construct identities, and compete with out-group members for scarce resources.)</p>
<p>Weber’s sociology put an emphasis on ideology. Capitalism, for example, was the result of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICppFQ6Tabw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideological conditions unique to Northern Europe</a>; capitalism has only succeeded where these ideological conditions hold.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emile Durkheim</strong> (1858-1917) built on Comte’s positivism, setting forth <em>structural functionalism</em>. In structural functionalism, a society is viewed like a biological cell: different parts of a society are likened organelles. Durkheim’s sociology looks at how the parts work together to comprise the whole. It is also holistic – much of how systems thinking was used in the social sciences built on Durkheimian notions of society.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>Karl Marx </strong>(1818-1883) provided an approach which contrasts with Durkheim’s: instead of seeing harmony, it emphasizes the role of class conflict in society and the historical-economic basis thereof. Marxist sociology has also been known as <em>conflict theory</em>, though the historical-economic basis is not the only way one could study conflict. For example, Weberians see conflict rooted in ideology, rather than in a clash over resources.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="20th-Century-Social-Theory"><a href="#20th-Century-Social-Theory" class="headerlink" title="20th Century Social Theory"></a>20th Century Social Theory</h3><p>While classical theory is often referred to in terms of thinkers (Marx, Weber, etc), the more modern movements tend to be known more by schools of thought. Some of the major ones would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Neo-Marxism</strong> refers to the 20th century updates of Marxist theory, which  has pulled in Weberian and poststructuralist work on status and power.  Antonio Gramsci is a well-known neo-Marxist, who was curious about the  question of why the revolution Marx had predicted never seemed to come about. Gramsci is most famous for his theory of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cHThwyA8RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural hegemony</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical theory</strong> is also based on Marxist thought, and is often conflated with it. Critical theory emphasizes <em>praxis</em>, the combination of theory and practice. Critical theory is most associated with the Frankfurt School, including names such as Theodor Adorno and Jurgen Habermas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interactionism</strong> assumes that all social processes are the result of human interaction. It emerged in the early 20th century. Interactionaists focus their studies on the interactions between individuals. As a result, interactionists do not `see’ the effects of physical environment – or even solitary thought/work. They also reject quantitative data in favour of qualitative approaches: grounded theory and ethnomethodology were both developed by interactionists. The notion of social interaction as a performance was first developed in interactionist thought; poststructuralists have since refined it. While there’s no single name associated with this perspective, some associated names include George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, and Dorothy Smith.<br>Sociologists also look at social systems at different levels: the <em>macro</em> level looks at entire societies, nations, etc; the <em>meso</em> level looks at organizations, institutions, etc; the <em>micro</em> level looks at individuals. While classical sociology was generally macro, interactionism focuses on the micro level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Structuralism</strong> might be seen as a macro-focused backlash against interactionism’s focus on the micro. Structuralism sees social processes as stemming from larger, overarching structures, and also emerged in the early 20th century. Structuralists see society as being governed by these structures in a somewhat analogous fashion to how physicists may see the universe as being governed by laws of nature. A criticism of structuralism is that it sees these structures as fixed; in contrast a Marxist would focus on historical change. Some structuralists include Claude Levi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, and Jean Piaget.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Poststructuralism</strong> (more or less interchangeable with “postmodernism”) is not a particularly coherent school of thought. This is not altogether surprising as the key poststructuralists both reject the label and the very notion that there is such a real thing as poststructuralism. Poststructuralists reject the idea of “objective” knowledge: since the study of sociology is done by humans who are biased by history and culture, they argue that any study of a social phenomenon must be combined with how the study of that social phenomenon was produced. For example, a poststructuralist would not take a concept like `gender’ as a given, but problematize the concept. Poststructuralism evolved out of structuralism in the mid 20th century. Some major poststructuralists include Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler.</li>

        <p>I’ve been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bourdieu</a> kick for the course I’m currently taking on social theory (LHA 1803Y: Theory in Higher Education), and since <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Easterbrook</a> mentioned he wasn’t familiar with Bourdieu, I figured I’d write a quick and dirty introduction to Bourdieu’s social theories. Steve’s a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416545842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+in+systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems thinker</a> so this is written for such an audience.</p>
<p>In systems thinking we like to think of people as existing in many (overlapping) social <em>systems</em> (because, after all, pretty much everything to a systems thinker is a system.) These social systems can be things like school, work, a professional community, or even your favourite internet community.</p>
<p>Bourdieu would call those systems <em>fields</em>. (Specifically, a field is a system of social positions, with internal structure.) In his terminology, the rules determining the system/fields are known as <em>nomos</em>. (Fields are not the same as class, which I’ll get to later.) When people in fields ‘play by the rules’ of the system, and invest in it, he calls this <em>illusio.</em></p>
<p>If you’re wondering if he also has paradigms in his systems, the answer is yes! He calls them <em>doxa</em>, the concepts and ideas which go without saying as it comes without saying – “the universe of possible discourse”.</p>

<h2 id="Individuals"><a href="#Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Individuals"></a>Individuals</h2><p>As an individual, I interact with numerous fields. There are two things that matter about me in how I interact with these fields: my capital, and my <em>habitus.</em></p>
<p>Bourdieu distinguishes numerous forms of capital:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>economic capital</em>, how many financial assets I have</li>
<li><em>social capital</em>, who I know, my social networks, what I can get out them, etc.</li>
<li><em>cultural capital</em>, the knowledge, skills, advantages and education that I have – along with the cultural ‘know-how’ of how to navigate particular social situations</li>
<li><em>symbolic capital</em>, the resources available to me on the basis of honour, prestige, recognition, or my other forms of capitalA thing worth noting about capital is that its value is context-dependent. For example, my knowledge of Star Trek trivia (which is cultural capital), has use in nerdy fields like computer science, but less so at gatherings of my extended family. Similarly, my Canadian money is of lesser value outside of Canada, and even less value were I to visit a society with a bartering or gift-giving economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for <em>habitus</em>, the description on Wikipedia wraps it up nicely: “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_%28sociology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the habitus </a>could be understood as a structure of the mind characterized by a set of acquired schemata, sensibilities, dispositions and taste”. Your habitus is developed in part through socialization. Bourdieu conceived of habitus as a way to study the interaction area between individual and society – in software engineering terms you might think of your habitus as being the coupler between an individual and society.</p>
<p>Every individual has a habitus – but likeminded individuals together can have group habitus. For example, a <em>class habitus</em> would refer to sensibilities, dispositions, tastes and ways of thinking about the world that are common to a social class. </p>
<h2 id="Class"><a href="#Class" class="headerlink" title="Class"></a>Class</h2><p>Unlike previous social theorists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weber</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marx</a>, Bourdieu’s view of class is not based on just economic capital, but instead on all capital (social, cultural, economic, symbolic). For me this is an appeal of Bourdieu: it explains why a ‘blue collar’ tradesman making the same amount of money as a ‘white collar’ adjunct are not really the same class.</p>
<p>Much of Bourdieu’s work looks at the reproduction of social inequality. He identifies feedback loops (though not by name) of what keeps the classes separate – and cultural capital plays a major role. How much cultural capital a person has, and to what social standing they are born, are determine their social mobility.</p>
<p>Those with a large amount of cultural capital in society are able to determine <em>taste</em> in society – such as what is low-brow vs. high brow (and everything in between). And people judge other people based on taste – does somebody ‘fit’ into a particular field? When people don’t fit in to a particular field, <em>symbolic violence</em> is used to keep them out or make them feel uncomfortable. Symbolic violence (also known as symbolic power) comprises things like implicit biases, microaggressions, de facto discrimination, and all that other lovely stuff that’s used to “keep them in their place”.</p>
<p>Symbolic violence allows for the reproduction of social divisions. A kid growing up in a working class family is going to have less access to means of accumulating cultural capital, is more likely to be affected by class dispositions to not value education as highly, and is more likely to say and do things when interacting with intellectuals that make them stick out like a sore thumb. Indeed, Bourdieu focuses extensively on the little things that stop people (or allow people) to accumulate capital – what they wear, the things they say, the hobbies they have – for him it’s all about the gain on the feedback loops here. The word ‘accumulation’ tends to come up a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><p>The stories women have of not feeling like they belong in tech/CS are the type of thing very amenable to a Bourdieusian analysis. Indeed, his early work focused on how the French university system amplified social inequalities (both in terms of gender and of class – and the intersection of the two, well before the term _intersectionality _took off).</p>
<p>His work has been used quite a bit by sociologists to look at the reproduction of social inequalities – for example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21133/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> used Bourdieu to examine how low-income minority ethnic groups feel alienated when they go to science museums – and why they don’t really go to them in the first place (hint: <em>habitus</em> plays a role – they have not been socially conditioned to see museums as a thing worth going to).</p>
<p>In many ways Bourdieu was a systems thinker – he thought of feedback loops, systems-within-systems, and systems-level behaviours, structures, rules and paradigms – but did not have the systems thinking vocabulary available to him. While he was active at the same time as the Systems Thinkers in the English-speaking world, few Systems Thinking based books have been translated into French – and most of the translations happened after Bourdieu died in 2002 (for example, Limits to Growth <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Limites-croissance-dans-monde-fini/dp/291777035X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416549088&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=donella+meadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t translated into French until 2012</a>!)</p>

        <p>There’s been a fair bit of research finding that negative stereotypes are part of what deters women and racial minorities from computer science and STEM in general (e.g. [1]). These stereotypes make it harder for women and minorities to personally identify with computer science, and amplify some of the biases that they face in CS. So for this post, I’ll be going over observed phenomena in social psychology and sociology that pertain to stereotype change.</p>
<h3 id="Stereotypes"><a href="#Stereotypes" class="headerlink" title="Stereotypes"></a>Stereotypes</h3><p>Stereotypes are really hard to change. They’re reinforced from many sources (media, individuals, groups, etc). But even more than that, stereotypes are <em>schema</em>: they are how we mentally organize information about social groups, and how we can determine whether we are “in” or “out” of a group. Schema allow us to process information effortlessly, and are pretty deeply ingrained once they’re there. </p>
<p>The human brain is not very good at changing schema. When we see evidence that contradicts our schema, our brains will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to avoid confronting or changing the incorrect schema. Most frequently, we forget that we saw it all. Sometimes our misconceptions even get stronger [2].</p>
<p>This happens with stereotypes. Betz and Sekaquaptewa did a study where they showed role models to young girls, to try to motivate the girls’ interest in STEM [3]. Role models were either gender-neutral, or feminine. The result? Gender-neutral role models boosted interest – and feminine (counterstereotypic) role models actually <em>reduced</em> girls’ interest in science. To these girls, the feminine scientist – a stereotype violator – is aberrant.<br><a name="more"></a><br>Stereotype violators are not viewed favourably by others. Indeed, in laboratory settings, people go out of their way to punish stereotype violators [4]. Stereotype violators are seen as less likable, and less competent. Not surprisingly, women in science are rated as less likable and less competent than otherwise identical men [5, 6].</p>
<h3 id="Subtyping"><a href="#Subtyping" class="headerlink" title="Subtyping"></a>Subtyping</h3><p>So, let’s say instead of being exposed to just one woman scientist, you are exposed to a bunch of them. Regularly. That will change your schema, right? Nope.</p>
<p>The human brain does a thing that social psychologists call <em>subtyping</em>. Instead of changing your mental model of what a scientist is (white male), you instead create a new category: the <em>woman</em> scientist [7].</p>
<p>And the evidence is that this is what happens to female scientists, and to female engineers [3]. Furthermore, the stereotype of the <em>woman</em> scientist is of an unfeminine woman. The unfeminine label in of itself is costly: these women are seen as less likable, less attractive, less competent, and less confident [3].</p>
<h3 id="Perceived-Variability"><a href="#Perceived-Variability" class="headerlink" title="Perceived Variability"></a>Perceived Variability</h3><p>So how can we change stereotypes, then? It turns out a thing called “perceived variability” is key: it’s how much variation we perceive in an out-group [7]. “Out-group” here refers to any group that a person does not identify with; an “in-group” is one that that person identifies with. Humans systematically underestimate the variability within an out-group, particularly in comparison to the variability within the in-group (e.g. men see women as more homogenous than they are; whites see aboriginals as more homogenous; etc).</p>
<p>This is known as the <em>Out-group homogeneity effect.</em> We mentally exaggerate the stereotypical qualities of outgroups (and outgroup members), and ignore the counterstereotypical qualities.</p>
<p>We stop paying attention to stereotypes when we perceive greater variability in the group that’s been stereotyped [7]. For example, it’s a lot harder to think about aboriginals in terms of generalizations and stereotypes when you’re used to thinking about the differences between Inuit, Metis and First Nations, and differences between the Haida, Salish, Blackfoot, Anishinaabe, Innu, Mi’kmaq, Dene, etc.</p>
<h3 id="Subgrouping"><a href="#Subgrouping" class="headerlink" title="Subgrouping"></a>Subgrouping</h3><p>So how can we increase the perceived variability of an outgroup? <em>Subgrouping</em> refers to the process in which both people members are brought together around common goals or interests, and can include both in-group and out-group members. For example, creating a study group in a computer science class in which both women and men are represented&nbsp; – or joining a robotics club which has a mix of white, Asian, black, and hispanic students.</p>
<p>Subgrouping “allows for a more varied cognitive representations of group members” [7] – it leads you to start seeing the members of your subgroup around their membership in your common subgroup – rather than their membership in any in-group or out-group. Richards and Hewstone have a very nice literature review about subgrouping and subtyping, showing how dozens of studies have consistently found that subgrouping leads to increased perceived group variability, and stereotype change.</p>
<p>The Contact Hypothesis in sociology gets at subgrouping: the observed effect that being familiar with a member of an outgroup (eg. homosexuals) increases your acceptance of the outgroup. Having a friend, classmate or family member who is queer means you a share with a subgroup with them (friend group, class, family, etc).</p>
<p>For subgroups to form effectively, they need to have meaningful cohesion to those in the subgroup. One study by Park et al that is described by Richards and Hewstone found that they could not form a subgroup around all engineering students: <em>“[they] were all hardworking and bright, but in very different ways. Some were motivated only by money, some by parental expectations, and some by larger environmental goals.”</em> Instead, there subgroups of engineering students formed, around those three motivators. [7]</p>
<p>Similarly, Park et al found that they could not form subgroups around continuous variables (high/moderate/high) or arbitrary bases [7]. And other studies in the Richards and Hewstone review found that trying to form subgroups around having minority status (e.g. clubs for women in STEM, study groups for black students) either did not change stereotypes about their group, or intensified them [7].</p>
<p>Indeed, I wouldn’t be surprised that part of why instructional techniques  such as Peer Instruction disproportionately helps female CS/physics students is because  they encourage subgrouping. When you have your whole class together, collaborating in small groups for class activities, you’re having them bond as classmates – rather than as members of in-groups or out-groups.</p>
<h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h3><p>This is one reason I’m always a bit iffy about Women in CS/Science clubs: they don’t promote stereotype change, but instead promote subtyping. Instead of changing the notion of what a computer scientist is, they reinforce the subcategory of <em>woman</em> computer scientist.</p>
<p>But stereotypes aren’t the only thing that affect minorities. Part of why Women in CS clubs are so popular is that they provide a sense of community to these women. This is really important when you’re a minority member! The sense of isolation that many women experience in STEM is why many of them leave.</p>
<p>And, as always, is evidence that girls only schooling can be good for encouraging young girls’ interest in math and science [8]. It’s somewhat of a tragedy of the commons problem: putting all the women together in a club helps those individual women cope with a culture in which they are negatively stereotyped – but it doesn’t change the actual stereotype.</p>

        <p>The rates of female participation in CS – and STEM in general – vary wildly from culture to culture. In the US, women currently make up about 18% of undergraduate CS students [1], but over in Qatar, women make up about 70% of CS undergrads [2].</p>
<p>Women in STEM are better represented in countries such as Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, and the Philippines. In these countries, women make up approximately 50% of STEM undergrads [3]. Indeed, well-developed countries like Canada, the US, and the UK have some of the lowest levels of female participation in STEM.</p>
<p>So, what cultural factors lead to fewer or more women in STEM? Per the work of Barinaga, there are five factors [3]:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recently developed science capabilities, resulting in an unentrenched scientific community</li>
<li>Perception of science as a low status career</li>
<li>Class issues that overshadow gender issues</li>
<li>Compulsory math and science education in secondary school</li>
<li>Large social support for raising families<br><a name="more"></a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="New-to-Science"><a href="#New-to-Science" class="headerlink" title="New to Science"></a>New to Science</h3><p>While it’s a bit surprising that Portugal and Mexico have better levels of female participation in science despite these countries not having well established scientific scenes, the evidence is actually that they have these better levels <em>because</em> of the newness of their scientific communities [3]. In countries like the US and the UK, the scientific communties have entrenched cultures. So called “old boys networks” were built up before women were allowed into the labour market; science has been firmly established as a masculine occupation. Portugal, for instance, begin its scientific and technological establishments in the 20th century, when society was more open to female participation.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that while countries like Portugal may have large numbers of women in science, few are making it to the top. Beatriz Ruivo, who studies female participation in Portugese science, has found that the<br>glass ceiling there is partly due to the lack of a strong women’s movement in Portugal [3]. We see an interesting parallel in the history of computer science. In the early days of computer programming (30s-60s), most programmers and coders were women [4]. It was later when stereotypes of programmers being nerds developed – and IT companies began specifically hiring those who were like the nerds in order to make up for a labour shortage in the late 60s – that programming became highly masuclinized.</p>
<h3 id="Science-As-a-Low-Status-Occupation"><a href="#Science-As-a-Low-Status-Occupation" class="headerlink" title="Science As a Low-Status Occupation"></a>Science As a Low-Status Occupation</h3><p>It is fairly established in the sociology literature that, across cultures, the lower the status and pay an occupation, the more likely it is that women will be found there [3]. And not only are women more socially encouraged to stay in low-status occupations, but some occupations are reinforced as having low status due to the large numbers of women – forming “occupational ghettos”.</p>
<p>This was certainly the case in the early history of computer programming. Women were traditionally “computers” – those that did the hand computations, whereas men actually did the science [5]. When computers entered the mix,<br>it was the men who were to decide what the computers should calculate, and women were left as the low status “coders” to carry out the low-level work [4].</p>
<p>For countries with recently developed science communities, basic science is not highly connected to the production of goods and services. Science is hence seen only as an intellectual, cultural pursuit – not unlike how the humanities are regarded in the US and Canada. The humanities in North America are frequently (and unfortunately) derided as being “useless” – and have largely equal levels of women and men in modern day.</p>
<p>In computer science, it has been noted that male students often select careers in CS for the money. As computer science has become known as a lucrative field, more men have been specifically drawn to the field – and driving out their female colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="A-Matter-of-Privilege"><a href="#A-Matter-of-Privilege" class="headerlink" title="A Matter of Privilege"></a>A Matter of Privilege</h3><p>In India, southern Europe, and Latin America, the social hierarchy puts high class women above low class men [3]. In these countries, education is often limited to the upper classes, resulting in a very different environment in academia than in the general population.</p>
<p>In North America, women from affluent communities, with parents in IT, were more likely to go into computer science themselves [6]. In short, the more privilege you have, the more likely you are to study CS – for instance, a White woman from a rich family and urban neighbourhood is more likely to have a job in STEM than than an Aboriginal man from a poor, rural family.</p>
<p>For computer science, the digital divide plays in to class issues [6]. The low classes not only are less likely to receive higher education, but also less likely to be connected to modern computing. Without a connection to computers, one would expect fewer of them to study computer science.</p>
<h3 id="Compulsory-Schooling-–-And-Mindset"><a href="#Compulsory-Schooling-–-And-Mindset" class="headerlink" title="Compulsory Schooling – And Mindset"></a>Compulsory Schooling – And Mindset</h3><p>Former Soviet countries have higher rates of female participation in science, and Barinaga attributes this partly to the requirement that all secondary school students take multiple science courses and mathematics [3]. As a result, girls “can’t ‘chicken out’” of science and don’t close doors on themselves before they reach university’’. The policy of teaching all science subjects, in particular, is beneficial – when students can choose one science out of a list (as is the case in many Canadian provinces), female participation in physics is reduced.</p>
<p>The American approach of science being optional – and hence avoided by all but the gifted students – leads to a mentality to that you either have talent in science, or you don’t [3]. This fixed mindset approach to science has been consistently found detrimental both to individual success in science, as well as for minorities. In countries like Italy, where all sciences are mandatory, the communal mindset about science is a growth mindset: <em>anybody can do it</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Support-For-Families"><a href="#Support-For-Families" class="headerlink" title="Support For Families"></a>Support For Families</h3><p>Forty percent of women who leave the workforce cite their husbands – and specifically, their husbands’ inability to pull their weight with housework and childcare – as their reason for leaving [8]. The United States was described by Barinaga’s international participants as <em>“just a horrible place to try to raise a family and have a career’’</em>. Without state-mandated parental leave, allowances for dads to stay home to look after children, and daycare, it is difficult for many women to manage both career and family.</p>
<p>Contributing to the problem is the Protestant work ethic for men, leading men to focus only on work and leave everything else to their wives. In northern Europe, Canada, and the US, fathers spend less time looking after their families [3]. Female science participation is higher in countries where childcare is a <em>shared responsibility</em>: not just between father and mother, but also with the extended family, and society at large.</p>
<p>This shared responsibility needs to be present in the workplace too; as one of Barinaga’s participants described: <em>“if I missed a half-day of work [in the United States because] my kid had a temperature of 104, I was lectured on how this let down the [department]. In Israel there is 3 months paid maternity leave, day-care centers on every block, and if you don’t take off from work for your kid’s birthday party <strong>the department chairman will lecture you on how important these things are to kids and how he never missed one while his kids were little</strong>“</em> (Emphasis added).</p>
<h3 id="A-Final-Note"><a href="#A-Final-Note" class="headerlink" title="A Final Note"></a>A Final Note</h3><p>Culture is a complex issue. None of the issues listed here can be a panacea for North American STEM. For example, even if we made CS obligatory in high school, it’s unlikely to have an effect for many racial minorities (Black/Hispanic Americans,  Aboriginal Canadians, New Zealand Maori, etc), as these groups have low rates of high school  completion [7]. By identifying these cross-cultural factors that promote women in STEM, we can better identify what factors (plural!) need addressing here in North America.</p>
